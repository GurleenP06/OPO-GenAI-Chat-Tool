Scope : Who : OPE/OPA When : OPE/OPA with the input of CIA , may need to delay a CO incorporation to allow depletion of stock , or issue a Flip Flop CO to consume excess inventory . CO DELAY & FLIP FLOP Responsabilities OPM must have agreement and alignment with all stakeholders prior to initiating the Decision process . OPE/OPA to lead meeting in order to get agreement from all responsible approvers that will be signing the route ( same as on the CO ) . OPM to understand if a new Modsum or Tranport Canada approval is required . OPM is the only group that can initiate the delay or flip flop change . All COs/ECOs where the planned incorporation is a date or ESN and this was determined solely by hardware availability are authorized to use this process . The OPE/OPA will trigger the request by sending a PLM route that shows the justification for the request to the CIA that will process the request .

The OPE / OPA is responsible for creating and sustaining the plan to help monitor major milestones , highlight any delivery issues and calculate the potential excess inventory . An evaluation of the program risks needs to be performed in order to highlight areas of concern in the Industrialization Plan ( Ref . OPMWI 3.10.3 Manage Program Operations Risks ) . In the case of a Service Bulletin ( SB ) or a CO that requires Customer concurrence ( Ref . EOP 100 ) , lead time to obtain customer concurrence should be accounted for in the Industrialization Plan . This plan will list the key milestones and help determine the best option between a white CO , shipment restriction CO or order risk hardware ordering . If a decision between Shipment Restriction or risk hardware is needed , the decision tree in Appendix C can be used to provide guidelines which only apply to Certified Engines . For non certified engines , refer to OPMP 3.11 , Section 15 - Delivery of Production engines .

Any new tooling requirement is coordinated with the OPE / OPA . For COs that contain a section for `` Service Engines Affected '' , or Control Service Use ( CSU ) which allow the use of a specific configuration in the field only , a COID is not done on these parts , OPM therefore does not provide an incorporation . Once issued , these COs are loaded in SAP by the CIA and Aftermarket Parts Planning is responsible to load demand and forecast . More specifically for CSU , if the substantiation is deemed successful , the CSU is cancelled and replaced by a CO to incorporate in production and in the field . 8.2.3 Provide Incorporation Upon receipt of completed COID , CIA will contact the OPE / OPA to determine incorporation date based on current part WIP / new part lead time and targetted incorporation ( customer commit , product improvement target , etc . ) aiming to meet block incorporation months . OPE / OPA should obtain OPM Manager 's concurrence for `` Scrap estimate '' .

"OPM Manager 's concurrence for `` Scrap estimate '' . If material is reworkable , the OPE / OPA ensures this is taken into account in determining the incorporation date or Engine Serial Number ( ESN ) . Once agreed with OPM , CIA provides the incorporation month / year or ESN . 8.3 Phase 3 - CO Signature Cycle Once the CO ballot is completed , comments and corrections are included in the draft CO , then the LCI initiates the final CO signature cycle . At this step , it is important to check that the incorporation date is accurate before OPM approves the CO. For COs that contains only `` Service Engines Affected '' or CSU , OPM does not provide an incorporation , but is still required to sign the CO . In the rare event that LCI does not publish the CO within 14 days after the incorporation is provided , CIA with OPE / OPA will evaluate if the incorporation date is still valid . In case of `` Shipment Restriction '' , once substantiation is complete and DVPM is signed , the `` Lift Shipment Restriction '' CO is published but it does not require a ballot , only a final signature cycle . On NPI program , no `` Shipment Restriction '' CO can be raised until the engine is fully certified and an Engine Type Certification is issued by Transport Canada . The first production engine is allowed to ship only once Manufacturing Approval is granted ( ref . OPMP 3.1 Manufacturing Approval ) . This document is electronically controlled .

This allows the visibility of the engine schedule and triggers Supply Chain actions . On NPI programs , the OPE / OPA requests the Build Specification ( BS ) from Engineering and establishes the BS load date .

It is then the responsibility of Supply Chain to follow up on the scrap disposition in a timely manner . economical . Supply Chain is accountable to get the excess material reworked when possible and 8.4.3 Determine the Engine Serial Number As the incorporation month approaches , the OPE / OPA monitors depletion of previous configuration and status of new part . Once the Engine production orders are opened in SAP , the OPE / OPA with the CIA determine the Engine Serial Number which will appear on the Bill of Material Change ( BMC ) . If during that analysis , the Engine Serial Number is earlier than anticipated due to previous configuration shortage , the incorporation needs to be advanced ( refer to Section 8.5 ) . If on the other hand there is an excess of the previous configuration , and if there are no customer or program commit , an evaluation to Delay CO incorporation needs to be performed ( refer to section 8.6 ) . 8.4.4 Service Bulletin Publication This document is electronically controlled .

In order to ensure the SB is published when the incorporation engine ships it is necessary : • To understand with Customer Support and Marketing , the customer requirements for SB publication . If there are specific customer requirements they are listed in EOP100 ; • If customer signatures are needed , evaluate the lead time of that signature cycle once the CO is released . The SB release timeline should be included in the Industrialization Plan . For an APU with primary design regulation under EASA , the SB number must be assigned in SAP but the SB does not have to be published concurrently with the introduction of parts in production engines ( Ref : Publications Procedures Manual No . 1-20 Service Bulletins ) . 8.5 Advancing a CO Incorporation Sometimes the published incorporation date of a CO may need to be advanced for several reasons . OPE / OPA must obtain agreement and alignment with all stakeholders prior initiating the request . The CIA will then advance the applicable BMC serial number upon receiving the OPE / OPA 's request via email . The CIA then sends via email an ECSN ( P & WC 5351 - Engineering Change Schedule",OPMP_5_10_CO_Incorp_Mgmt_WEB.pdf,OPMP_5_10_CO_Incorp_Mgmt_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/05_CO_Incorp/OPMP_5_10_CO_Incorp_Mgmt_WEB.pdf
"CO may need to be advanced for several reasons . OPE / OPA must obtain agreement and alignment with all stakeholders prior initiating the request . The CIA will then advance the applicable BMC serial number upon receiving the OPE / OPA 's request via email . The CIA then sends via email an ECSN ( P & WC 5351 - Engineering Change Schedule Notice ) to inform Supply Chain , Process Planning and Technical Publications ( SB release ) that the incorporation in SAP is earlier than the published CO incorporation date . 8.6 Delaying a CO When it is no longer possible to meet the original incorporation specified on the CO and no engine has been built with this upcoming configuration , the OPE / OPA can initiate a delay CO after obtaining agreement from all stakeholders . Upon approval of the route by all stakeholders , the CIA will process the delay request . The CIA then sends , via email , an ECSN to ensure the SB effectivity is modified accordingly . Note : Please refer to DPMP 3.0 Management of Delay and Flip Flop Changes . 8.7 Flip Flop CO This document is electronically controlled . Copies may not be the latest version .

Note : Please refer to DPMP 3.0 Management of Delay and Flip Flop Changes . 8.8 Reverting a CO A revert CO is used to return to the previous configuration , when the incorporated CO is not meeting design intent or quality requirement . A revert CO can be used whether or not the engine with current configuration has been shipped . The revert CO allows to go back for all or some of the components to the prior configuration . This revert CO is valid until a new CO is issued to introduce another configuration as opposed to a Flip Flop which is for a defined quantity of engines .

The decision to revert a CO is taken at the PMT or Safety Management System ( SMS ) level . Engineering will raise the revert CO . In the case that the CO is not yet incorporated , the OPE / OPA can request to cancel the intent of the CO. No revert CO is required in that case . 8.9 Ship Short CO In rare occasions to satisfy program needs , it is sometimes necessary to deliver engines without specific unavailable hardware that will follow later . The ship short CR can be initiated by OPM or Engineering with the concurrence of Marketing with a strategy on how the engine is tested and shipped . The CIA , with the responsible OPE / OPA , obtain the information to complete and submit the Ship Short Memo ( P & WC 11365 ) to Finance . The CO to rescind the ship short condition is supplied on the original CR . A rescind CO is needed to reinstate the parts in the engine BOM . A NOP for the ship short parts must be added in SAP and tracked to ensure the required hardware is ordered by Supply Management . Note : Please refer to OPMP 4.11 Production Hardware Management . 9.0 Engineering Red Flag and Limit Notice An Engineering Red Flag Notice ( RFN ) can be used by Engineering to introduce an urgent design change to resolve either a component life issue , clarify an engineering definition or meet a Customer requirement .

OPM shall escalate at the PMT or PMMT level any delay foreseen in the release of the Engineering RFN or The RFN process is initiated by Engineering with the concurrence of OPM , to authorize actions that stop procurement of hardware from Suppliers or Producers ( raw material , part assemblies , detail , etc . ) , and / or stop engine manufacturing or shipment ( P & WC 7736 ) . The RFN document contains committed dates for action completion from : Design ( DID and DVPM completion ) ; Drafting ( Drawings Advanced Released ) ; and DPM ( Publication of CO ) , and is signed by Engineering and OPM . A Limit Notice ( LN ) only limits production of raw material , parts , assemblies or end items ( P & WC 7741 ) . It will not stop procurement of defective hardware as its intent is to limit quantities received and manufactured until a CO is published to change a configuration . It is therefore not used following an EMM , but to minimize the eventual scrap anticipated after the CO is incorporated . The RFN and LN are `` lifted '' ( or closed ) only when the CO is published ( ref . EOP 22 ) . 9.1 Roles and Responsibilities The OPE / OPA attends the EMM or IPT to understand the issue and risks to the program . At the request of Engineering and OPM , DPM drafts the RFN or LN document . Once it is completed and signed , DPM publishes the document , tracks the action completion until the new CO is published . In case of RFN or LN , OPM is a key stakeholder responsible to communicate with all organizations impacted ( Engine Centre , Supply Management… ) in order to develop and follow a recovery plan . More specifically , OPM provides : affected Part Number and name , Operations affected and effect on engines in Assembly , Test or Shipping area . Project Engineering provides feedback on engines in experimental flight test and on engines in service . 9.2 Applicability This document is electronically controlled .

In these situations the OPE / OPA ensures an Engineering RFN is raised , tracks closure of target lift dates and escalates any slips to the PMT . • On Legacy programs following an EMM , an Engineering RFN may be required to stop production of parts or engine shipment . A Quality Red Flag and an Engineering RFN may be used in parallel when deemed necessary to contain and identify parts as per Quality Red Flag to continue production , and at the same time introduce rapidly an improved configuration . • LN are rarely used because of their manual nature : there is no block existing in SAP to limit PO placement and part delivery . OPM needs to ensure that the required quantity of parts allowed as per the LN are received ( no more , no less ) , and that if there is a delay in issuing the CO , a supplementary amount of parts to bridge the gap is ordered outside lead time .

For NPI : File Industrialization Plan in SharePoint under 03_Industialization Filename : CONumber_Program_Description ( Ex . : CO-0002774_PW127N_Phase3_Incorp ) Preferably , a `` White '' CO is the best option since it allows the full lead time to complete the substantiation plan and permits depletion of all available material of the current configuration which means no risk to the program . If a `` white '' CO is not possible , make a decision between ordering Risk Hardware or issuing a `` Shipment restriction '' CO to ensure Customer commit is met . Use Table 1 in OPMP 5.10 which shows the major differences with success vision between Risk Hardware and `` Shipment restriction '' and Decision tree in Appendix C to help guide the decision . Note 1 : OPM Manager needs to be made aware when a `` Shipment restriction '' CO is considered . Note 2 : A `` Shipment Restriction '' is not allowed on parts with Intercheangeability Control ( IC ) as per Drafting Requirement Manual DRM 241 because the primary role for an IC drawing is to provide flexibility in Procurement by defining two or more `` Approved '' ( substantiated ) options for a given part number . If Risk Hardware is deemed required , these steps must be considered : 1 . Identify the requirements for the Risk Order ( quantity , cost and date ) ; 2 . Evaluate the risk to the Program if substantiation is not successful ; 3 . Estimate if scrap risk ( likelihood and value ) is acceptable to the Program ; 4 . Determine the cost maintaining inventory if Program or CO is delayed / cancelled . 5 . Include UPPAP clause in order to facilitate part transfer to production Note 1 : Advance release drawing must be available to place a risk hardware order . Note 2 : Refer to Table 1 and Decision tree in Appendix C of OPMP 5.10 . If a `` Shipment Restriction '' CO is deemed required , the following actions must be performed : 1 . Monitor the substantiation plan to ensure it meets the target implementation plan ; 2 . Ensure there is enough lead time to re-start previous configuration if need be ; 3 . Fill in Quarantine Release Request / Authorization if need be ; 4 . Track `` Lift shipment restriction '' CO release to ensure shipment of production engine . Note 1 : OPM Manager needs to approve the PLM workflow to allow loading of SAP . Note 2 : Refer to Table 1 and Decision tree in Appendix C in OPMP 5.10 .

"1 and Decision tree in Appendix C in OPMP 5.10 . Ensure that the impacted production tooling set ( gauges , callipers , etc . ) for Canadian Manufacturing units , Assembly & Test tooling for Engine Centre and OEM tooling are discussed at the IPT level . OPM is responsible to provide an Internal Order to purchase these tools . For urgent CO 's , you can contact your DMP team lead and request that this CO be added to their priority list . Phase 2 - Change Order Ballot Cycle Initiate the ballot of a draft Change Order ( CO ) to sollicit inputs from various organizations ( Engineering , Legal , Aftermarket , Weight , etc. ) . Note : OPM is on the ballot as `` FYI only '' and for the CIA it is the signal to initiate the COID process . Upon receipt of CO Draft ballot - MUST validate material disposition code as per IPT / PMT agreement : are parts reworkable , need to scrap or divert to other active programs , etc . If not aligned , bring to the attention of PMT / IPT for resolution . If correct , proceed as per normal CO issue process . Note : You can also verify engine model , part numbers , compliance code , etc . and highlight any discrepancies to DPM . Note : If OPE / OPA is aware of change of supplier , needs to advise his CIA , so the COID will go to the correct NPI buyer . The Change Incorp . Analyst ( CIA ) / Cyient is initiating the Change Order Incorp . Data ( COID ) process with Supply Management , Campus and Spares to understand the WIP of current part and LT of the future part , tooling needs and other information to update the Material Master such as USM or VSM status , MRP Controller & Buyer codes , etc . COID route is also sent to Process Planning to fill in the section of tooling for availability & lead time purpose . Note : When multiple COs are in `` conjunction '' , it is important to take into consideration all COIDs in order to determine the earliest possible incorporation date . Once tooling availability and lead times are known , it is the responsibility of the OPE / OPA to coordinate tooling delivery with Canadian Manufacturing units , Engine Centres and OEM . When only Service engines are affected in a CO or when a Controlled Service Use ( CSU ) CO , there is no COID collected . Note : OPM does not provide an incorporation for Service Engines or CSU .

"for Service Engines or CSU . However , once CO is issued , parts are loaded in SAP by CIA , but the OPE / OPA does not monitor the incorporation for these types of changes . Complete the COID within 10 working days . Note : Depending on the urgency to provide incorporation , the OPE / OPA may follow up with the COID recipients to obtain the information quickly and get involved to support in case there is no valid quote . Upon receipt of completed COID , contact the OPE / OPA to determine incorporation date based on current part WIP / new part LT and targeted incorporation ( customer commit , product improvement target , etc. ) . OPE / OPA can request the COID summary sheet which will show the status of all parts affected . If there is no target incorporation date , deplete current stock ( Phase-in / Phase-out ) . CIA , after discussion with the OPE / OPA , will provide an incorporation month / year ( targeting block month when possible ) . If there is a CO `` in conjunction '' with the first CO , it automatically has the same incorporation . Note 1 : OPE / OPA can challenge excessive WIP quantity . We should only take responsibility for what P & WC is liable for . Note 2 : Sometimes current configuration , as stated on the COID & CO , can be `` retained for spares '' . To be considered during the incorporation decision . Note 3 : If you ca n't deplete all stock and parts are reworkable , request Supply Management to obtain quote from the supplier . If there is a customer commit that requires an incorporation date prior inventory depletion and spares are unable to take on this inventory , communicate via email to the CIA the justification for documentation purpose . Note : This email authorizing an earlier incorporation than a Phase-in / Phase-out , will be kept on file for future reference , there is no standard format , but it must contain a complete justification of why we agreed on scrap or to incorporate `` Out of block '' . Note : In case of incorporation in the near future , coordinate with Publications to ensure SB is issued prior engine delivery . If there is a need to load an `` Out of Block '' and / or there is anticipated `` scrap '' following the introduction of the CO , request e-mail confirmation from the OPE / OPA . If `` preliminary scrap '' is higher than $ 25K , advise Ops . Finance ( dept . 1261 ) to add to the existing scrap `` Reserve '' . Send an email entitled : `` Information for Reserve for PN `` , in the email ; add reference CO # and a brief justification ( Example : customer commit , volume fluctuations , etc. ) .

Phase 3 - Change Order Signature Cycle Receive CO workflow to review and approve . Validate the Part Disposition Code and incorporation date provided to ensure it aligns with IPT decision . Note 1 : In case of `` Shipment Restriction '' , once substantiation is complete and DVPM is signed , the `` Lift Shipment Restriction '' CO is published but it does not require a ballot , only a final signature cycle . Note 2 : For COs that contains only `` Service Engines Affected '' or CSU , OPM does not provide an incorporation , but is still required to sign the CO . Monitors CO publication within 14 days from the incorporation date returned in SETS . In the rare occasions that DPM does not publish the CO within the recommended 14 days , the CIA could restart the COID process . Note : If the CO is not signed within 14 days after incorporation was provided because significant errors found during ballot or signature . The CIA may elect to simply call COID recipients to understand if there is a significant change in the WIP of the previous part or simply repeat COID cycle if necessary . Class IV which creates AMD ( Assembly Manufacturing Drawing ) are initiated by Process Planning , OPM ’ s approval is required on Class IV only when AMDs are linked to a BS . Note : For Class II and Class III ( adds Mfg . Drawings ( MD ) ) CO , OPM Manager / OPE / OPA do not sign . Phase 4 - Change Order Publication Once CO is released , load SAP as per process ( validate AFS with Process Planner ) and advise OPE / OPA when completed . Note : A list is issued daily for the CO published . If you do not receive it , please send an email to : GP PWC ECActivity < gp.pwc.ecactivity @ pwc.ca > Ensure a CO to lift `` Shipment Restriction '' is issued prior to engine shipment . Note : If SAP was loaded with a `` Shipment Restriction '' CO , the substantiation is not completed and therefore must be completed ideally before parts are shipped to P & WC to avoid pulling them from Quarantine to build the engine or even to have an engine waiting substantiation to ship . Ensure SAP clean-up has been done on the cancelled parts ( safety stock removal , QM lot cleared , PO aligned , etc. ) . Ensure P.O . for new parts are placed to meet demand .

Ensure P.O . for new parts are placed to meet demand . If obsoleted parts are reworkable , raise special PO ( repair/replace ) to return material to supplier following agreement of rework cost ( Quote & LT ) . If not economical to return parts to the supplier , job order could be created to perform rework in-house . Note : Supply Management should refer to SM WI 00-08//06-02 ( Create Purchase Order for Additional Charge Items ) . Ensure SAP demand is adjusted for previous configuration and the new one . For a propulsion engine with primary design regulation under TCCA , SBs are published concurrently with the introduction of parts in production engines . In order to ensure the SB is published when the incorporation engine ships it is necessary : • To understand with Customer Support and Marketing , the customer requirements ( Ref : EOP100 ) for SB publication ; • If customer signatures are needed , evaluate the lead time of that signature cycle once the CO is released . The SB release timeline should be included in the Industrialization Plan . For an APU with primary design regulation under EASA , the SB number must be assigned in SAP but the SB does not have to be published concurrently with the introduction of parts in production engines . ( Ref : Publications Procedures Manual No . 1-20 Service Bulletins ) There might be exceptions to the above such as : - OEM requirement to receive a production engine without a published SB ; - Shipping containers when P/N does not change ; - TOL ( only change on the CO – it parts change also , then SB is needed ) ; - EI ( only change on the CO – if parts change also , then SB is needed ) . Upon receipt of `` Class 1 EC PO delivery vs EC incorporation details '' ensure PO is placed for the new parts with the agreed source . Note : SB number and publication status is shown on this report ( column AH ) . For Engine Shipping Container : Note : Engine Shipping Containers are `` non-product '' and there is specific process to introduce them to the BOM . In case of last minute pull-in or experimental transfer to Plant 0001 , ensure there is an Inspection Plan in place . ( QP03 : Enter Material , Plant & Profile QM01 ) Note : There is a systematic process in place to create Inspection Plans 8 weeks before POD when a PO is placed in Plant 0001 , it is periodic and based on PO placement in Plant 0001 only .

If Risk Hardware was ordered ( Plant 0102 ) ensure PO 's are cancelled as soon as SAP is loaded to avoid receiving production part in Plant 0102 . In case material is still received in development , transfer experimental inventory via a Material Transfer ( inspection , QN and disposition by Engineering , etc. ) . Note 1 : If experimental raw matl . has been shipped against the purchase order , risk hardware will need to come through the experimental store directly and allow at least 2 weeks for part transfer to production store . Note 2 : If a QRA-A was deemed necessary , advise the Quarantine Crib Inspector to close the QRA-A prior engine shipment . Monitor depletion of previous configuration and receipt of new configuration , in order to chose the Engine Serial Number ( ESN ) for the incorporation of the CO . Note : If during that analysis , the Engine Serial Number is earlier than anticipated due to previous configuration shortage , the incorporation needs to be advanced ( refer to section `` Advancing a CO Incorporation '' below ) . If , on the other hand , there is an excess of previous configuration , and if there are no customer or program commit and evaluation to Delay CO incorporation needs to be performed ( refer to section `` Delaying a Change Order Incorporation '' below ) . Once the Engine Production Order is opened ( 10 days prior engine start date ) , contact the OPE / OPA to agree on the optimal Engine Serial Number to put on BMC . In some cases and /or depending on the OEM , it may be necessary to ensure that the incorporation takes into account shipsets : to have engines with same configurations ( SB listing in the logbook ) on the same A/C . While this is mandatory for some changes ( ie . software ) , it maybe preferable on other changes ( Oil Side Glass ) to be discussed during the IPT meeting . Note 1 : As a best practice , when possible , avoid end-of-quarter , end-of-year CO incorporation , to minimize Engine Centre flow disruption . Note 2 : A BMC is always issued for a Table of Limits ( TOL ) , Clearance Index Chart ( CIC ) and Engineering Instructions ( EI ) updates , there is no SB to be published at Engine shipment for TOL or EI unless there is also a hardware change associated with the TOL or EI .

Rule : Cancelled parts should be retained until the added part is incorporated in production and has proven to meet the design intent . Validates Scrap Authorization ( ZMSCRAP ) with OPE / OPA to approve or reject . For the scrap amount , OPE / OPA validates with original planned scrap estimates . Needs to verify if part can be reworked or Flip Flop used . For high dollar value parts , you may want to approach Component Solutions to see if they could take this excess . Advancing a Change Order Incorporation If there is a shortage of previous configuration parts , then the incorporation of the CO needs to be advanced . Validate if the SB can be published in time for engine shipment and readiness level of Engine Centre . Send an email to CIA to document the need to advance the CO incorporation ( no new CO required ) . Note : If customer concurrence is required , Project Engineer will ensure it is received on time for revising the incorporation . After consulting with the OPE / OPA , pull in the incorporation in SAP according to missing quantity of previous configuration ( no CR required ) and issue a new BMC & ECSN ( P & WC 5351 Engineering Change Schedule Notice ) to reflect the new engine S/N via PLM workflow . Note : If pull-in is within the initial incorporation month on the CO , no ECSN is sent . The ECSN will inform simultaneously : Supply Management : To realign purchase orders accordingly .

A `` Flip Flop '' CO allows to re-introduce an already incorporated configuration ( i.e . : the engine has shipped with new configuration ) , if there is an issue with procurement of newly introduced configuration and there are undepleted available parts from the previous configuration . This allows to keep shipping the engine while resolving the issue with the newly introduced configuration . A `` Flip Flop '' is always for a defined quantity of engines .

OPE / OPA provides serial numbers of affected engines in concurrence with CIA . If the Engine Production Orders are not opened yet ( S/Ns not available ) , the BMC can not be sent , so evaluation needs to be done later when the Engine Production Orders are opened in SAP . Note 2 : Best option for the CIA is to perform this task on already open engines . If deemed necessary , inform PMT , Supply Management , Spares , Engine Centre of the `` Flip Flop '' CO in order for them to communicate it to the customer if necessary , or to reprioritize work in Process Planning . CIA will issue ECSN report in order to advise Tech Pub to change SB effectivity . Reverting a Change Order A revert CO is not to be confused with a `` Flip Flop '' . It is used when the new configuration is not incorporated yet or already incorporated ( i.e . engine is shipped ) , and the newly introduced configuration no longer meets design intent ( for example : conflicts with another configuration already introduced , or impossibility to pass off engines ) or quality requirements . The revert CO differs from the `` Flip Flop '' because it is not for a limited quantity of engines , the revert is valid until another new configuration is introduced . The revert CO can revert fully ( all the parts ) or partially ( some of the parts ) . In the case that the CO is not yet incorporated , the OPE / OPA can request to cancel the intent of the CO. No Revert CO is required in that case . Engineering will raise the Revert CO , and the process starts from Phase 2 - Draft CO . Ensure Supply Management is made aware and that they can support the re-introduction of previous changes to meet program requirements . Note : COID is needed to provide an incorporation .

Such a plan should include : 1 . Customer or program commit - Is there a firm date for the incorporation ? 2 . Risk to the program - understand the risk of not meeting Design intent ( What is `` Plan B '' ? ) 3 . When are new parts available - new part LT ( including tooling ) 4 . LT to obtain quote , and negociate the contract ( if needed ) 5 . Demand in plant 0017 , is a campaign planned , what is the volume ? 6 . What is the capacity of current or new source ? 7 . What is the design availability target date in the RFN ( Design ) as indicated on P & WC 7736 ? 8 . What is the drawing availability target date ( Drafting ) as indicated on P & WC 7736 ? 9 . What is the DPM target date to lift RFN by publishing the new CO as indicated on P & WC 7736 ? 10 . Is this date satisfactory to meet customer or program commit ? 11 .

Ensure signature of P & WC 7736 , and track the completion by ensuring the committed dates are respected by all organizations . Note 1 : Engineering Red Flag is `` lifted '' ( or closed ) only once the CO incorporating a new configuration is issued . Note 2 : The Eng RFN publication is done via PLM notification Once the Engineering RFN is published by DPM : Ensure parts are blocked from Procurement ( Code 11 ) by sending an email to Material Master ( GP.PWC.MATREMM @ pwc.ca ) ( cc : Account Specialist ) . Send an email as this ensures that Material Master Data team ( Accenture ) receives the instructions from OPM owners only to add or remove Code 11 from Material Master . If Code 11 needs to be removed for specific and well understood reasons , send an email to Material Master . Note : Code 11 in the Material Master , blocks PO placement on the part number ( s ) , part ( s ) receipt and pull on an engine . Once the RFN is published by DPM : Communicate with Supply Management , Process Planning and Engine Centre . Ensure quote is received for the new part . Provide an incorporation - COID is needed , but depending on the urgency , the incorporation may be provided based on feedback from Supply Management ( COID information will follow ) . Ensure a part recovery plan is created , maintained and tracked for the procurement of part to be implemented by the new CO .

End of process Limit Notice ( LN ) - P & WC 7741 If the IPT decision is to issue a Limit Notice , Engineering with the concurrence of OPM , will request DPM to schedule a Limit Notice meeting with all stakeholders i.e . Engineering , OPM , Design and DPM . A Limit Notice aims at limiting production of raw material , parts , assemblies or end items , until a CO is published to change a configuration . It could also be used when the publication of a CO is imminent and when we know in advance of the COID that there is already too many parts in stock ( Plant 0001 , Plant 0017 , Plant 0102 ) , in WIP at vendor . Note : OPM Manager needs to be made aware as soon as a Limit Notice is considered . Complete preliminary assessment of hardware location , quantities and cost . Obtain from Engineering a Level 3 Plan for CO publication . Decide how many of each part number will potentially be needed until the CO is incorporated . Depending on scope of the LN ( quantity , complexity , risks to the program , customer commit , etc . ) prepare a LN Industrialization plan based on the preliminary assessment done in previous step . Such a plan should include : 1 . Customer or program commit - Is there a firm date for the incorporation ? 2 . Risk to the program - understand the risk of not meeting Design intent ( What is `` Plan B '' ? ) 3 . When are new parts available - new part LT ( including tooling ) 4 . Demand in plant 0017 , is a campaign planned , what is the volume ? 5 . What is the capacity of current or new source ? 6 . What is the design availability targed date as indicated on P & WC 7741 ? 7 . What is the drawing availability target date as indicated on P & WC 7741 ? 8 . What is the DPM target date to lift LN by publishing the new CO as indicated on P & WC 7741 ? 9 . Is this date satisfactory to meet customer or program commit ? 10 . Evaluate if Risk Hardware needed vs Shipment restriction CO ? 11 . Ensure Customer concurrence ( EOP 100 ) is obtained if needed ; 12 . UPPAP ; 13 .

For NPI : File Industrialization Plan in SharePoint under 03_Industialization Filename : CONumber_LN_Program_Part_Name_Description_YYYYMM Contrary to an Engineering Red Flag , the parts are not blocked for Procurement activities in SAP . It is therefore the mandate of the OPE / OPA to communicate clearly to all stakeholders : - Quantity of parts needed for each part affected ( quantities may differ for each part affected depending on Stock , WIP , etc . ) - Ensure that only quantities needed are received in SAP ( no more , no less ) ; - Follow-up on CO publication with Engineering ; - Request DPM to hold another meeting to adjust quantities of parts to be limited based on delays in CO release date ; - Communicate with Supply Management to limit / stop the WIP , obtain written confirmation that action has been performed and ensure the agreed upon quantities are received on time to the LN Industrialization Plan . Note : LN are rarely used because of their manual nature i.e . there is no SAP block ( no Code 11 added in the Material Master unlike an Engineering Red Flag ) . This requires regular maintenance and an effective communication with Supply Management and Engineering . Once the LN is published by DPM : Communicate with Supply Management , Process Planning and Engine Centre . Ensure quote is received for the new part .

ACRONYMS 2.0 BS : Build Specification APU : Auxiliary Power Unit RC-APU : Radial Commercial APU OEM : Original Equipment Manufacturer 3.0 PURPOSE 4.0 5.0 5.1 5.2 In order to support the business architecture for Radial Commercial APU ’ s it is necessary to load Build Specification ( BS ) numbers and their corresponding Radial Commercial APU part numbers in SAP . The intent of this document is to define which pairs of BS number and RC-APU part number can be loaded in SAP . SCOPE This work instruction applies only to Radial Commercial APU ’ s . DESCRIPTION DEFINITION PW & C does not have manufacturing or design authority over Radial Commercial APU ’ s . As such , governance of loading BS numbers related to RC-APU ’ s in SAP resides entirely with OPM . INSTRUCTIONS Each time the need arises to load into SAP a new BS number and its corresponding RC-APU part number , OPM will request to Aftermarket to provide both numbers : BS and RC_APU . Once the BS number and RC-APU part number are identified , OPM will update the table in Appendix A and roll the version of this document . The new version of this document will be used to load the new BS number and RC-APU part number into SAP . The table in Appendix A is to be updated only when a new BS number needs to be loaded into SAP . For BS numbers already loaded into SAP , changes to its corresponding RC-APU part number will be controlled by Engineering Changes and not by this document ( OPMWI 5.2.1 ) .

This document is to serve as the FSC reference for the FSC audit trail as well as providing the program and IPT FSC targets to be incorporated into the Product Definition Requirement Specification ( EOP 49 ) . Cost IPT : A series of dedicated FSC IPT reviews aimed at managing the program FSC throughout the lifecycle of the engine to action initiatives , as required , and orient technical and commercial decisions towards achieving the engine FSC business case target as established in the CBN . The team is represented by all business units considered as FSC stakeholders . FSC : Factory standard cost is the tool that P & WC has adopted in order to establish and compare the cost of engines and their components . The FSC is the summation of the cost of purchased materials and processes plus the in-plant cost . FE : Financial exposure is the cost impact from the risk assessment related to the associated current supplier selection , contractual situations and sourcing strategy elements DEFINITIONS IPT : Integrated Product Team are active at the engine module , assembly level and detail part level . They are responsible for ensuring that product requirements established by the PMT are achieved in the design , development , manufacturing and aftermarket phases . LTPA/PA : Long term purchase agreement is a contractual bidding documents between P & WC and a supplier which states all contractual requirements necessary to allow a commercial relationship .

Give this enough time to honestly explore the options . Visualize structural shapes that match the load . These will probably not be constant cross-section slabs with a lot of understressed material . General ( there will always be exceptions ) minimum mass , lightweight design principles : wires for tension , tubes for compression , space frames ( truss works ) for bending , monocoque shells for torsion , the outer fiber carries the load , the load travels to the stiffest part of the structure , avoid stress concentrations , etc . Adjust these principles as required for practical implementation . Try to avoid or minimize expensive secondary operations such as heat treating and machining large work pieces off machines . Run trade studies as needed . Try to work out a simple assembly scheme that avoids difficult ( tight tolerances , extreme flatness , poor tool and fastener access , special fixturing , etc . ) interfaces . Take the initiative to invite front end participation from quality , manufacturing , purchasing , legal , vendors , marketing , tooling , etc . Don ’ t expect or wait for the them to call you .

Design to Cost Key Performance Characteristics ( KPC ) Design to Cost Key Performance Characteristics ( KPC ) We rely on Statistical Process Control to “ centre ” the batch The minimum process requirement for all dimensional KPC ’ s is to be in statistical control . To certify processes related to KPC ’ s , a Cpk value of greater than or equal to 1.33 is required . In reality , the distribution usually trends towards the Maximum Material condition dimension . Reminder A value on the max limit is not a rejection KPC ’ s are not free . Additional costs ( process reviews , more inspecting & trend monitoring ) will be charged for a KPC . Example ; A supplier was charging ~ $ 10 per KPC on each part Design to Cost Key Performance Characteristics ( KPC ) Once a Cpk value of 1.33 or higher is demonstrated , a reduced sampling plan may be allowed for KPC2 features . If a Cpk of 1.33 can not be maintained for KPC2 features , then 100 % inspection will be required .

Ensure that surfaces have exit grooves to avoid the Grinding Wheel damaging adjacent surfaces . Design to Cost Machining- Reduction of Set-ups Design to Cost Stamping Typical Stamping Processes BLANKING is an initial operation with a punch & die combo for cutting outside contours . PIERCING is the production of inside contours/holes . It generally follows blanking , or can be done together . In progressive stamping work , it is done first , with blanking as the last step . COMPOUND DIES stamp both inside & outside contours together in a single station tool . It is the most accurate method for concentricity & flatness . PROGRESSIVE DIES are used for high volume stamping . A part is moved through progressive tool stations . COINING is a closed-die squeezing operation with material displacement up to ~60 % . SWAGING provides indentations of up to 100 % material displacement . It is a squeezing operation where the material plastically flows into a die . EXTRUDING is a punch & die combo forcing the material to plastically flow through a die opening . Sheet metal parts are candidates for stamping Depending upon the volume of parts , Stamping can be cost effective Design to Cost Joints Typical reasons for a joint .

This is most important when welding without filler metal . To limit distortion , proper joint design & welding procedures are required . Distortion can be controlled by fixtures , heat sinks & special welding techniques , however avoiding distortion completely can be very costly & difficult . A cost effective approach is to allow some distortion in the design .

"To limit distortion , proper joint design & welding procedures are required . Distortion can be controlled by fixtures , heat sinks & special welding techniques , however avoiding distortion completely can be very costly & difficult . A cost effective approach is to allow some distortion in the design . Example , a weld too close to a hole can change the hole shape Cost will increase if a part has to be masked for “ splatter ” or cleaned after welding Plating of spot welded joints can cause plating salts to be trapped that require special cleaning . Design to allow easy draining of plating solutions Design to Cost Joints- Brazing When materials with poor weldability are to be joined Brazed joints are less expensive * * than ; butt welds ( accurate trim dies & fixtures required ) mechanical joints ( extra weight & required ) Other cost advantages are ; when a brazing cycle coincides with a heat treatment cycle when several brazed joints could be baked simultaneously * * Except when brazed with a filler of silver , gold or Pal Nicro . Brazing ; Joins metals ( similar & dissimilar ) & non-metals ( i.e . metalized ceramics ) Heat is applied by induction heating , torch or furnace Uses filler metals with melting temperatures +840°F ( below the melting temperature of the materials being joined ) . Design to Cost Joints- Brazing Compared to other metal-joining techniques ( example , welding ) brazing has many advantages such as ; Since brazing does not melt the base metal of the joint , it allows much tighter tolerances & produces a clean joint without the need for secondary operations . Brazing produces less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a brazed piece . Brazing is easily adapted to automated production processes . Disadvantages are ; Joint strength is lower than a welded joint Brazed joints require a high degree of base-metal cleanliness Some brazing applications require the use of fluxing agents to control cleanliness . The joint color is often different than the base metal , giving a poor appearance . Note , Soldering and brazing are very similar processes , except brazing is done at higher temperatures Resistance Welded Joint Brazed Joint Built-in cracks Weld nugget Full coverage over width In areas with high vibratory , thermal & mechanically induced stresses , resistant welds can be prone to cracking Brazed joints can be used to improve fatigue resistance Braze & Resistance weld joints are ~same cost if heat treat is done with the Brazing cycle Design to Cost Joints- Brazing Combined Resistance Welded/Brazed Joint The most common type of brazing joint is the lap joint . Key guidelines are ; Parts must be closely fitted . Parts must be clean & free of oxides The best overlap for a brazed joint is 3T or 4T ( T is the thickness of the thinnest parent metal part ) .

Target Cost Should Cost Supplier Quote Business Case Manufacturing Value Market Value Design to Cost “ Should Cost ” Definition A typical “ Should Cost ” Process can be applied to machined & sheet metal parts . ( No capability yet at P & WC to estimate Castings , Forgings , Composites , Electro-Mechanical & Electronics ) . A Should Cost estimate is useful , however ; It must not be confused with the Market Price ( usually different ) Does not replace the quotation process to get the best possible price Remember , a Should Cost is an estimate only . Design to Cost “ Should Cost ” Definition , Key Points A Should Cost Estimate is a snapshot in time and definition only . It does not indicate possible trade-offs with adjacent parts and systems interaction to obtain an optimum design . A Should Cost estimate assumes ; The best manufacturing processes & does not cater for supplier capabilities The best way is not necessarily how a supplier will produce a part . Mature processes Manufacturing development period is over All processes done at the same supplier Only Plasma Coatings are assumed to be done by 2nd supplier P & WC “ Should Cost ” Process applies to machined & sheet metal parts . ( Limited capability at P & WC to estimate Castings , Forgings , Composites , Electro-Mechanical & Electronics ) . Adequate input detail from Engineering is required for Should Cost Estimates ( e.g . coatings , Special processes , tolerances , Inspection techniques , Accuracy requirements , Assembly techniques , etc ) .

Design to Cost Ecodesign Example Section 10 Dimensional Management Design to Cost Dimensional Mgt Why is a tolerance on a part dimension required ? No one or thing is perfect What is the definition of a tolerance ? Allowance for variation in the geometry and properties of a part Since variation is inevitable , an acceptable amount must be specified Tighten the tolerance on the part ? Reduce the affect of contributors ? or What is the best way to improve a critical design parameter ? Early identification of critical design parameters is the key to good design & reducing the need for expensive tolerances Design to Cost Dimensional Mgt As variation is inevitable , ways to manage its effects are required . ( 3 methods were stated in the DFV Section ) By Margins . For example , if a dimension comes consistently out of a process at ± 0.010 ” & the limit is ± 0.020 ” , then the margin is sufficient and no action is required to manage the variation . B ) By Limits ( worst case ) . Use of min & max limits is usually the common approach , however sometimes use of extreme limits can lead to uncompetitive products especially when multiple parts are assembled together . C ) By Capabilities . Managing dimensions by understanding the variations on a part functional reqts and capabilities of the manufacturing & inspection methods to be used .

( A recent Newspaper ) . Outside a Zoo in England there is a parking area that was managed for 25 years by a very nice attendant . One day he did n't show up , so the Zoo asked the City for another attendant . The City said that the parking lot was the Zoo 's responsibility . The Zoo replied that the attendant was a City employee . The City replied that the attendant had never been on their payroll . Anyway , on a beach somewhere is a man who installed a ticket machine and then went every day to collect the parking fees . $ 1000 per day for 25 years .

The Product Cost team will provide the latest FSC roll-up at engine maturity ( learned out cost ) with major contributors and highlights identified and also explain the gaps to the CBN and the last IA . Data reconciliations , waterfalls , line charts , risk cubes and other required graphs will be optional depending on the agreement of the scope at the kick-off meeting from SFV and all other key players . This can differ from one light IA to another . 6.3.3 Delta Gap Analysis A delta gap analysis has a reduced scope from a full IA . For a delta gap analysis , the product cost team will provide the latest estimate of the FSC of the engine program without going into the full process described above at 6.3.1 . This will include : latest FSC roll-up at engine maturity ( learned out cost ) with major contributors and highlights identified . Data reconciliations , waterfalls , line charts , risk cubes and other required graphs from the last investment audit will be used to perform the process . 6.3.4 Passports Reviews Passport Reviews are a gated review process that is used by the Passport Review Board ( PRB ) to approve the progress of major product development projects . The intent of the process is to secure senior management ’ s authorization to enter into the next phase of the program . For a full description of the process , refer to MMP220 . The Product Cost team will use the latest IA as the FSC update to be used in passports and internal FSC reviews throughout the year . It is best practice to align the Passport and Investment Audit schedules when possible . If this is not possible , then the Product cost team will perform a sensitivity analysis in order to assess if there are specific situations , risks and/or opportunities that have occurred since the last IA in order to quantify the delta . Also , funded cost reductions will be included when performing investment audits and CBN ’ s and unfunded will be segregated under other opportunities . * * Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp.

For NPI engines , it will be recommended as part of the budgetary process to plan for a cost IPT at all times . For legacy engines , this will be done by introducing a comprehensive prioritization tool allowing for the Product Cost team , in collaboration with the Finance organization to evaluate a series of variables that will allow to identify which engines have the most important opportunities . Variables such as Top Line Revenue , Gross Margin , EBIT contribution , Market Position , Direct Maintenance Cost ( DMC ) analysis , Fleet Management Program ( FMP ) / Eagle Service Plan ( ESP ) / Pay per Hour ( PPH ) should be considered . Once prioritization has been completed , a suggested list of engine programs requiring a cost IPT will be brought forward and subject for debate with the core leadership team ( Engineering - Product Cost - OPM ) . 7.3.2 Establishment of Cost IPT Meetings , Conduct and Stakeholders The product cost team will organize a meeting with the OPM/Engineering program managers/directors and propose the cost IPT ’ s to be held with supporting data from the prioritization exercise described above as required . After agreement , each program managers and/or the operations program managers need to establish budget requirements for their respective programs . The Cost IPT team will be comprised of the following groups : Engineering , Product Cost , OPM , Supply Management ( NPI and strategic sourcing , Finance , Manufacturing ( Campus , GO & S and Assembly ) and Manufacturing Project Engineering Product Cost Manager , Engineering Program Manager and Operations Program Manager are the Cost IPT co-leaders ; schedule meetings and record minutes .

"List of all the reports What ? When ? Whom ? * Long Range Planning : ( “ LRP ” ) † Cost Basis Note : ( “ CBN ” ) Cost-basis note vs investment audit Investment Audit and Cost Basis Note are Similar but Fulfill Different Objectives Compare and contrast * Capitalization Approbation Request : ( “ CAR ” ) † Request for Quote : ( “ RFQ ” ) Then year dollar vs constant year dollar The Higher the Discount Rate/Inflation/CPI ; the Lower the Present Value of Future Dollars Why it is important In our everyday lives , we work with dollars in nominal terms ( known as then-year dollars ( TYD ) in the industry jargon ) . However , when it comes to financial planning and modelling , all future dollar values needs to be discounted to the present to account for the time value of money , so that all dollars are comparable from year to year . When a dollar value from the future is discounted to the present , we call that constant-year dollar ( CYD ) or otherwise known as dollar in real terms . The Analyst needs to be cognizant of the type of information they receive as inputs . Example : the sourcing team works with outside suppliers and contracts . As such , they always work in then-year dollars ( nominal dollars ) . This is so because contracts and agreements do include year over year escalation provision for inflation and such . Given that , it is the job of the Analyst to always ensure that any financial projection given to sourcing for validation is always set in then-year dollars , and in turn any financial projections received from sourcing is converted as needed . EXAMPLE : CPI CPI Guidance is Provided by SFV and Finance Teams in Q1 of Every Year For buy-parts CPI captures the incremental inflation cost associated with the program that needs to be embedded into the overall engine cost projections over the long-term . The CPI rules are established early in the year , for that year , for new upcoming Passport 1 . Crucially , these rules are to remain fix over the life of the program , as that specific engine program progresses through Passport 2 , 3 etc . through the investment audit process . Given that the CPI assumptions are fixed every year , it is not hard to see that as the macro inflation picture changes over the years , those assumptions are challenged . Sometimes , ( to be checked every year ) there may be a requirement to do CPI minus 1 at EIS . The idea is that as the design matures by EIS , the CPI ought to be lower . EXAMPLE : Below is the sample of 2024 guidance we have received for the CPI application . This table implies that in 2024 , the part ( s ) ’ FSC already embeds current inflation , and that in 2025 , it will be",Standard Work Instruction.pptx,Standard Work Instruction.txt,https://xcollaboration.pwc.ca/team/D2400Product/Documents/SF%20Departmental%20site/25%20Standard%20work/Standard%20Work%20Instruction.pptx
"EIS . The idea is that as the design matures by EIS , the CPI ought to be lower . EXAMPLE : Below is the sample of 2024 guidance we have received for the CPI application . This table implies that in 2024 , the part ( s ) ’ FSC already embeds current inflation , and that in 2025 , it will be 2.5 % and that in 2026 and onward it will be 2.0 % . Unless that program is at EIS , than it would be 1 % . For instance , if the EIS takes place in 2031 , therefore the CPI to be used is 1 % , which is 2 % minus 1 % , as the EIS rule applies . stakeholder Stakeholders interacting with product cost OPM The role of OPM is to ensure flawless incorporation of Change Requests ( CR ) by phasing CO 's to meet both customer and P & WC commitments . OPM coordinates all activities required for implementation of a new CO including Operations business units , supplier , internal manufacturing and Engine Centre readiness . The role of Marketing is to represent the customer point of view to the company , for new programs for which there is an open request for quote ( RFQ ) , which in turn means a need for Cost Basis Note ( CBN ) from the Product Cost team . The Marketing team manages customer ’ expectations , commercial and technical requirements during the RFQ activities , but they are less involved for IAs activities . The SFV team manages the business case both for new programs ( i.e . CBN ) and/or existing programs ( i.e . IA ) . They quantify all the inputs ( one of which is the FSC ) needed for the business case into an NPV or IRR . The Finance team produces the manufacturing data ( i.e . shop-rates ) for our internal facilities in CAMPUS , Poland and other Canadian locations . They cover all the “ make-part ” as opposed to “ buy-part ” , which is covered below . The Sourcing team covers the “ buy-part ” on legacy programs , essentially managing the global supply chain external to P & WC . For clarity not including our P & W facilities in Poland and China . Most investment audit requires extensive collaborations with the Sourcing team . The NPI team covers “ buy-part ” but for new programs . Most new programs requires extensive collaborations with the NPI teams . The Partnership team manages the commercial and operational relationship with external partners . There are certain programs , where P & WC has made the decision to partner with external businesses . These risk-sharing partnerships allow P & WC and its partners to pool their resources and share the risk and reward . For clarity , we do not include FSC from partners modules into our FSC as those are not our cost to bear .

MARKETING Finance / Cost management SOURCING / NPI partnership Strategic financial valuation Car , passport and engine program investment guidelines Capital appropriation request A CAR is Set in Stone and Can Change Only Through CAR Supplement MMP-515 171024_MMP515 ( ray.com ) A CAR is required for all Engineering Development Programs where the Total Engine Program Investment is equal to or greater than $ U.S . 2 million . The CAR must include an economic benefit expressed as Net Present Value ( NPV ) and Internal Rate of Return ( IRR ) based on after-tax cash flows generated from the investment over the life of the program . This is derived from the business case prepared by the SFV team . The NPV and associated project investment cost must be converted to U.S. $ . The exchange rate assumed should be identified in the CAR . A supplemental CAR could be required during the investment phase . ( see MMP515 for different criteria ) * Capital Appropriation Request : ( “ CAR ” ) MMP-220 Microsoft Word - MMP220_EN ( ray.com ) MMP defines the gated review process that is used by the Passport Review Board ( PRB ) to approve the progress of major product development projects . The intent of the process is to secure the PBR ’ s authorization to enter the next phase of the program . P0 Permission to Study – Study Concept , P1 Permission to Offer - Authorize the submission of a technical and commercial proposal to the customer , P2 Permission to Continue Detailed Design [ Develop ] - Design and Develop the product , P3 Permission to Order Production Hardware - authorize the ordering of production hardware and identify any risk of ordering production hardware prior to completion of validation , P4 Permission to Deliver Serial Production – Authorize the manufacturing and delivery of products , P5 In-Service Program Review & Permission to Close Passport Process [ Support ] - Review the product performance versus product requirements defined in earlier phases and close passport process .

Therefore , a cross-section of the engine will more often be available as an initial input . We had one major exception that was a brand-new centerline . Various Passport 0-level programs or asks , will be at the different stages . Some are very early embryonic stage , some conceptual , some more definitive . Need to also get a BOM ( if available ) , if not start with cross-section . Who are the end customer ? Management of program ’ s cost is owned by Programs ; Investment Audit is owned by SFV Program end customer Although not explicitly stated in the various MMPs depicted in the previous slides , the “ program management ” team that oversees all aspect of a particular program , is one of the end customer of the CBN and IA activities . Program Management team has the most holistic view on all aspect of the program , including FSC and related activities . As such , they are the one connecting and presenting with the executive team to make decisions in terms of next steps . They are effectively the dotted-line manager to the Analyst . Program Management follows the Passport Process ( see MMP-220 ) , which uses FSC as input at every gate . However , there could be special cases where the Passport gate is waived because of non-material change to various inputs . In those cases , FSC Roll-Up needs to be checked but no detailed analysis is needed . end customer as per mmp-515 Once Program Management is clear on the path forward , it is the SFV team that looks at the entire business case from an investment return point of view . Therefore , they are the formal end customer of the CBN/IA processes that uses the FSC Roll-Up as an input , in order to quantify all aspects of the program into an IRR . SFV publishes and follows the Investment Audit schedule that is communicated at the beginning of every year . * Strategic Financial Valuation : ( “ SFV ” ) Passport process ( MMP-220 ) P0 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 Permission to Study Concept Permission to Offer ADVANCE DESIGN PROGRAMS ADVANCE DESIGN PROGRAMS Permission to Continue",Standard Work Instruction.pptx,Standard Work Instruction.txt,https://xcollaboration.pwc.ca/team/D2400Product/Documents/SF%20Departmental%20site/25%20Standard%20work/Standard%20Work%20Instruction.pptx

EXAMPLE : In an investment audit cycle , in the prior year ( 2022 ) , a cost estimate is used for a part , while in the subsequent year ( 2023 ) , we had actual quotations for that same part . The quotations was significantly higher than what was estimated in the prior year . Although , we don ’ t expect quote to equal estimate , a significant delta should warrant an investigation and recommendation by the Analyst . * Current Report : ( “ CR ” ) Manufacturing data xxx Best practices Cost Management ( Canadian , Polish MFG * Data ) There is a need to get manufacturing data ( Canadian , Polish MFG data ) from the Cost Management organization . This activity usually kicked-off in parallel . The Analyst ’ s responsibility is to provide its cut of the BOM to the Cost Management , for them to be able to respond accordingly . Canadian MFG : Cost Management provides shop-rate per cost center per LRP ( 5-years ) Polish MFG : Cost Management provides FSC for each p/n for 5-years . The information from Cost Management as it relates to cost , does supersedes the info previously gathered through costing . However , how that data integrates and impact the overall FSC is accountability of the Analyst .

Critical metal suppliers Current monthly FE do not include any FE related to alloys , hence that exposure is not captured in the FSC/ABC Tool and thus not captured in the business case for a given program . The Analyst is to take note that there are three critical alloy suppliers for which we need to pay extra attention depending on the context and program : Timet ( Titanium alloys ) SMC ( Nickel alloys ) Carpenter ( Stainless steel and nickel alloys ) How to assess impact ( if it is needed ) : Alloys are often sourced from the above suppliers directly by P & WC ( on behalf of the finished part suppliers ) to be able to get the best commercial terms . These p/n are only seen by Analyst in the BOM as finished material . There are cases , where we as a program need to understand the overall alloy exposure . That would involve additional activities involving in getting the program ’ s BOM crossed with material spec as well as ESA .

"Analyst in the BOM as finished material . There are cases , where we as a program need to understand the overall alloy exposure . That would involve additional activities involving in getting the program ’ s BOM crossed with material spec as well as ESA . If the ESA is there , that would allow the sourcing team to understand how much input alloy material was used for that part before being finished . As the finished alloy material is not a representative of the overall material consumption for a given part ( and thus its cost ) . If the ESA is not there , it would be difficult to ascertain that exposure . * Engineering Source Approval : ( “ ESA ” ) P & WC Major Alloy Suppliers Aggregate PO Placed for Raw Material Finished Part Suppliers Value Added and part finished Alloy Material Shipped Finished Material Shipped PO Placed for Finished Part USM vs vsm xxx Best practices USM-to-VSM Transition USM * relates to inputs parts that P & WC buys on behalf of its supply base . When it comes to PO/quotation , for USM it does not include the raw material needed , only the value add done by the vendor . VSM† relates to vendors that are procuring their own input material from which they will do their value add . When it comes to PO/quotation , for VSM it does include both the raw material and the value-add portion . When there is a transition from USM to VSM , in a situation where P & WC mandates that the vendor should be directly procuring their own raw material , there will be a price hike , which often supersede the reduction of P & WC own direct procurement . Therefore , to accommodate that risk , ( a likely net increase ) . We assume an approx . 10 % contingency . This is a one-time hike , which is spread over 5 years following the initial USM change to VSM in any given year . This 10 % contingency will be always added to outside vendors and some internal suppliers such Global Manufacturing ( i.e . SPWAEC , PWK , PWT and PWR ) . For clarity , it is not applied to CAMPUS1 , Plant-32 and Plant-41 . EXAMPLE : USM PO is $ 1,000 for a given vendor ; RM is $ 2,000 A USM-to-VSM transition takes place in 2024 , therefore : VSM PO = $ 1,000 + $ 2,000 + 10 % * ( $ 2,000 ) = $ 3,200 $ 200 is spread over 5 year ; starting $ 40 in 2025 , which the year following the USM transfer * User Supply Material : ( “ USM ” ) † Vendor Supply Material : ( “ VSM ” ) E & D Amortization xxx Best practices E & D Clauses There could be some clauses with some supplier ( s ) ( ex : Woodward ) , where their E & D investment can be",Standard Work Instruction.pptx,Standard Work Instruction.txt,https://xcollaboration.pwc.ca/team/D2400Product/Documents/SF%20Departmental%20site/25%20Standard%20work/Standard%20Work%20Instruction.pptx
", which the year following the USM transfer * User Supply Material : ( “ USM ” ) † Vendor Supply Material : ( “ VSM ” ) E & D Amortization xxx Best practices E & D Clauses There could be some clauses with some supplier ( s ) ( ex : Woodward ) , where their E & D investment can be amortized as we procure larger quantity of those parts on a cumulative basis . For clarity , although it is like “ volume discount ” , the difference is that the volume discount are usually per PO per year as opposed to cumulative as it is here . It is important to note that often times that given part is shared across multiple platforms , some of which may or may not have their own IA being performed . And those should be considered as well in the numbers . EXAMPLE : We are doing an IA for engine PT6AXX that is projected to have 50 units per year for an EEC part that has E & D Amortization starting in 2027 . That very same EEC part is also used on a PT6AZZ that is currently in production for which , we would have bought cumulatively 268 units by start of 2027 since program inception in 2018 . The contract says that if on a cumulative basis , we have procured less than 300 EEC we pay $ 15,000 per unit , but starting 301 , we will pay $ 14,000 . Therefore , in this case for PT6AXX , for 2027 , since 268 + 50 is greater than 300 , we can use the lower $ 14,000 contractual price in our FSC models . Once we hit the amortization threshold , the Analyst need to ensure that the FE file is in-line with the reduction . Although the accountability goes with Sourcing , it is a good check . * Engineering & Development : ( “ E & D ” ) Quotation escalation & estimate maturity xxx Best practices Quote Escalation – NPI Parts If we have quote that is more than 18 months old , there is set of contingency that is applied so capture any potential headwind . Best is always to get an updated quote from the NPI organization , but in absence of that the Analyst can use the guidance below : * Engineering & Development : ( “ E & D ” ) Estimate Maturity – Engineering Inputs In absence of a quotation , when the Analyst is generating an estimate , given the level of certainty , a contingency X % is applied . The contingency dollar value is in turn spread over two years , with year 1 being the upcoming year from today . This is applied both for parts for outside and inside vendors .

In these situations , the Analyst needs to create an estimate for it . To be able to estimate , the following inputs are needed : Geometry ( i.e . Drawings , 3-D models etc . ) Reference parts from which it is based Choose the type of estimate : Estimate from reference The most commonly used within the Product Cost team Estimate from Should-Cost The most commonly used external to Product Cost team ( Ex : NPI team might need a second opinion on a quote from a vendor ) Estimate using fundamental analysis Using knowns about machines and tools used , to compute and estimate cost . Extensive experience is needed . Estimate using parametric method Statistical methodology using set of features and measures to determine prediction equations , to scale cost . Where do get the reference parts . Cost Estimate Ultimately Costing Is More of an Art Than Science and Is Also Dependent on the Project Timeline Best practices for make-part Need access to CATIA/PLM to view ( reference ) drawings as well as the new drawing for the proposed part ( see bottom left of drawing for reference # ) Best practices for buy-part To get a Should-Cost estimate ( less needed as Analyst ’ s experience grows ) Also , the Analyst would inquire from the NPI/Sourcing team if assumptions made in the Should-Cost is valid Use transaction SAP CK13N or MM03 or ME1M The Analyst can use the FSC of reference part and add a contingency to it .

"Analyst Inputs boarded into the ABC/FSC Tool ( s ) Analysis , Comparison & Iterations Iterations continues until the “ gap ” to reference * is understood Affected inputs re-validated and adjusted ; DR Checklist ; Peer Review analysis Pre-requite are done , now … Prerequisite At this stage , once all the inputs that were available has been captured , and uploaded into the ABC Tool , and all need estimates have been done . It is understood that there could be information missing . Next Steps Review the FSC roll-up received ; compare and contrast to past Investment Audits or reference programs The Analyst needs to be certain that the cost difference between the roll-up and reference can be attributed to clear reason ( s ) . Building and substantiating the needed supporting documentation is part of this step . The analytical / investigative phase , could be the most extensive aspect of this whole job . EXAMPLE : For instance , there is cost increase on a blade that attributed by engineering to be due to material change . However , supporting factors do not explain the extent of the cost increase . The Analyst needs to own and understand what drove the excess increase . If that excess increase is justifiable ( ex : there is contractual aspect to it ) , that needs to be documented , and the inputs needs to be adjusted . If the excess increase can not be linked back to any known facts , then Analyst needs to provide an estimate him/herself . analysis There could be three main buckets with cause of concern … . Design Points to Look Into When Comparing to Reference Part ( s ) Are the parts different ? If not , see below . If so , in what way ? ( ex : material , sizes , change in geometry , tolerances , change in special process ) The Analyst needs to be close to design to better understand the new design from a feasibility point of view , since that drives the FSC .

": to understand the part list is complete , and “ delta ” are correctly allocated analysis Examples Design Points to Look Into When Comparing to Reference Part ( s ) Sourcing/Supply Chain ( Buy-part ) When Comparing to Reference Part ( s ) Change in contract , economics , force majeure and inflation indices Canadian sourcing Restriction constraints Background : P & WC may have some obligation with the Government in order to keep some parts in Canada . The Analyst need to understand the list of the parts , and how ( if at all ) these impact potential cost reduction ( or other ) outsourcing project baked into the business case . It is important to understand that this goes beyond the commercial business case . P & WC needs to make the case , how this path forward will benefit tax-payers at large . EXAMPLE : There is a specific definition at Pratt & Whitney Canada for components in the engine define as Major Core Component ( MCC ) . Here is the list of MCC define components that falls as “ restricted ” . All compressor rotor stages IBR ( excluding impellers ) Inner and Outer liner combustor All turbine discs stages All turbine blades Cost reduction sourcing strategy Dual sourcing Cost Benefit There is significant saving that can be accrued by either dual sourcing or fully shifting production to an existing lower-cost P & WC facility in Poland or SPWAEC . However , there are key items to consider … . Geopolitics Any dual sourcing outside North America needs to be done with an eye not only the commercial business case , but also the geopolitical cost-benefit analysis . It is very likely that outsourcing is hedged by keeping a ~20 % production in Canada , both to keep a potential secondary source as having optionality but also to have minimum production in Canada to keep the line going , lowering upfront cost should all volume should go to Canada . Government Obligations ( i.e . Omnibus ) It very maybe that P & WC has obligation with the Government to keep production of certain critical rotating parts as part of financing . Therefore , the Analyst need to look at when that Agreement expires before going dual source outside Canada . Any attempt to make a business case looking at accelerating ahead of that date , will require extensive study , to demonstrate to the Government the benefit to the taxpayers . Therefore , the business case is above and beyond a simple commercial business case . Global Line Rate in CAMPUS 1 As volume of parts are pulled from current CAMPUS1 production , to be dual sourced , there would be a FSC headwind on all line rates ( and vice versa ) . That global +/-ve line rate impact needs to be considered in the FSC calculation .

"CAMPUS1 production , to be dual sourced , there would be a FSC headwind on all line rates ( and vice versa ) . That global +/-ve line rate impact needs to be considered in the FSC calculation . Cost reduction sourcing strategy Dual sourcing Substantiation / Tooling NRE Cost Any dual sourcing , will have substantial upfront NRE cost due to substantiation needed and the tooling in the new production facility . While this may come to be seen as a strictly an NRE impact , it does have an impact on the recurring FSC cost in the out years as that high upfront cost seeps into the local line rate . EXAMPLE : For a 2023 RFQ , we had to consider outsourcing rotor compressor to SPWAEC ( China ) , as part of that investigation we confirmed that : - Rotor compressors were considered part of the MMC and therefore considered impact by Omnibus - It was confirmed that the Omnibus expired in 2028 ; therefore , it would be 100 % C1 to 2028 but then 70-30 % split in favour of SPWAEC after 2028 when our obligation expired - Following few executive level meetings , we concluded that we want a greater production in C1 at the expense of a higher FSC for the rotors ; so settled on 50-50 - There was also a negative impact on global line-rate due to pulling out 50 % of current rotor compressor production from C1 , that was need to be added to the FSC roll-up Iterative process Exit criteria Inputs gathered By the Analyst Inputs boarded into the ABC/FSC Tool ( s ) Analysis , Comparison & Iterations Affected inputs re-validated and adjusted ; DR Checklist ; Peer Review Iterations continues until the “ gap ” to reference * is understood DRL CHECK LIST and Peer Review See MMP515 Engine Program Investment Guidelines 171024_MMP515 ( ray.com ) Who and when Sharepoint Link https : //xcollaboration.pwc.ca/team/D2400Product/Documents/SF % 20Departmental % 20site/25 % 20Standard % 20work/PeerReview.xlsx * xxxx : ( “ DRL ” ) Iterative process Exit criteria Inputs gathered By the Analyst Inputs boarded into the ABC/FSC Tool ( s ) Analysis , Comparison & Iterations Iterations continues until the “ gap ” to reference * is understood REPORT OUT Affected inputs re-validated and adjusted ; DR Checklist ; Peer Review Report out , lead-time & End-customers Lead-time and end-customer See MMP515 Engine Program Investment Guidelines 171024_MMP515 ( ray.com ) Who and when End Customer Whether it is a CBN or an IA , the direct internal customer that will use the input is SFV and DMC teams .

They take into consideration , direct maintenance cost , factory standard cost , up-front CAPEX/engineering investment ( s ) , projected volume of sales , etc , where they apply a hurdle rate and discount back into an NPV and/or IRR . For an investment to be considered as accretive to the company , it must meet the 15 % rate of return hurdle rate . Direct Maintenance Cost : As it happens , one the inputs ( direct maintenance cost ) going to the SFV also takes FSC as input . Therefore , our work also paces the overall business case submission by pacing DMC . It is important to have an open dialogue with the DMC team in parallel of the FSC final submission , as often they tend to benefit from preliminary FSC data that are released to advance their work . Normal Lead-Time To submit a signed FSC , it takes 8-weeks , based on the assumption that all needed inputs have been received . That is the standard lead-time that is normally communicated when our team is asked for estimated . It can increase or decrease depending on circumstances . As a base-case , if the inputs are not frozen , the submission date moves day-by-day . Sometimes , the product cost team needs to perform other tasks in parallel to support the overall process . For instance , an in-depth SSRB that is led by OPM/Supply Chain with product cost as support , uses our resources .

Operations Program Management ( OPM ) will ensure that applicable CO will be initiated . AQP ? ? ? Steps required from OPM : - When there is already an open CR under Engineering , use it to generate CO. - In the case CR needs to be created , IPT decides who will provide I.O . and OPM could raise the CR . Model to model CO requires Design Intent Document ( DID ) and DVPM . Build Spec . to Build Spec . only requires a DID . A CO for conversion is not required if the engine is still within P & WC Manufacturing premises i.e . never delivered to the OEM . When an engine is converted from one build specification to another within the same engine model ( e.g . PT6A-42 to PT6A-42 different build specs ) ; When an engine is converted from one engine model to another after being shipped to Finished Parts Store or `` P & WC Leasing '' and has the same Serial Number prefix ( PW127M to PW127N - ED # # # # ) . Conversion model to model can not be performed within P & WC , only at OEM because the engine S/N can not be changed with the new model prefix ( Ref . : QMSP10-12 Control of engines / engine model identification dataplate ) . If we retain the original serial number for a model conversion it is going to create logistical issue because the Service Bulletin List is generated from SAP and SAP is programmed to recognize the engine serial number / model number link . SAP will not allow us to generate the SB list for a Y model ( ex . : PT6A-52 ) using a Z model ( ex . : PT6A-61 ) engine serial number . In order to change engine S/N after the original ARC ( Form-One ) is issued , we would need to `` retire '' the original S/N as per QMSP10-12-01 which would mean fully dismantling",OPMWI_6_10_8_Engines_Conversions_DRAFT.docx,OPMWI_6_10_8_Engines_Conversions_DRAFT.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/06_Mgmt_Delivered_Engines/Process_Improvement_Team/Engines_Conversions/OPMWI_6_10_8_Engines_Conversions_DRAFT.docx

In order to change engine S/N after the original ARC ( Form-One ) is issued , we would need to `` retire '' the original S/N as per QMSP10-12-01 which would mean fully dismantling the engine and return parts to parent departments as required . Conversion on returned engines Return engine from Finished Parts Store ( FPS ) / P & WC Leasing Co. Use Return Engine process from FPS if engine was never shipped at OEM . ( Ref . : OPMWI 6.10.2 FPS / Leasco Return Engines Process ) . “ Add & Cancel ” will be provided in the RECO file from Cyient under “ 77777-Conversion ” as there are no CO to refer to . Return engine from OEM Use Return Engine process from OEM . ( Ref . : OPMWI 6.10.1 OEM Return Engines Process ) . “ Add & Cancel ” will be provided in the RECO file from Cyient under the related Conversion CO . Conversions at OEM Conversions can be perform from Model to Model as well as BS to BS with the same process . When there is already an open CR under Engineering , use it to generate CO . In the case CR needs to be created , IPT decides who will provide I.O . and OPM could raise the CR . Will be covered by an OEUP ( Ref . : OPMWI 6.10.3 Original Equipment Upgrade Plan ) Conversions in WIP at Engine Centre Upon Marketing advising of model or BS change while engine is in WIP , Engine Centre Logistics department coordinates activities to virtually revert all actions already performed on the engine and re-issue into new engine . Title TBA Downgrade engine to experimental status To perform a downgrade either at P & WC or at the OEM , a CO is always required . In order to issue CO , an Airworthiness Quality Plan ( AQP ) must be issued by QS & P prior CO release . If downgrade is performed at P & WC : Engine is processed as a return engine to incorporate the downgrade CO. Transport Canada ’ s approval is required when changing the engine main data plate ( P & WC form 11667 to be filled by Engine Centre Quality ) . If downgrade is performed at the OEM : FSR must raise an RFA to document downgrade of the engine based on the CO. Transport Canada ’ s approval is required when altering the engine main data plate to add an “ X ” to the engine model ( P & WC form 11667 filled by QS & P ) .

Modification at OEM under X-engine When X-engine is at OEM , as Engineering defines new BS , they will ask to ship parts that are not part of the original engine BOM in order to perform the modifications even though production BS is not yet released . There is an agreement with QS & P that production part can be shipped with Form One to modify X-engine . Engineering should provide I.O . to ship the parts to OEM and they will provide build instructions to FSR / OEM . This will permit to keep parts on the engine when upgraded to production . OPE / OPA requests Planner to ship hardware to OEM . Upgrade from Experimental If engine upgrade is performed at OEM : FSR needs to raise an RFA and follow the AQP instructions ( raised by Project Engineer ) . A Special Instruction ( SI ) may also be available to support upgrade . Transport Canada ’ s approval is required when changing the engine main data plate ( P & WC form 11667 filled by QS & P ) . If engine upgrade is performed at P & WC : FSR raises RFA and returns engine from OEM . If engine has more than 50 hours , Engine Centre can perform the upgrade and other CO incorporation or reparation ? , but once a new type certificate is issued , no additional work is allowed into the production environment . Transport Canada ’ s approval is required when changing the engine main data plate ( P & WC form 11667 filled by QS & P ) . Conversion to new Build Spec ( BS ) A CO needs to be issued for the conversion . If engine has more than 50 hours , CO mentions “ For service engine ” . If less than 50 hours , CO mentions “ For Production Engine ” . “ For service engine ” : a SB needs to be published to provide instructions . “ For production engine ” : a SI for conversion engine is required if performed at the OEM . The SB can not describe the details of the conversion , it references a SI which covers the details for P & WC personnel only . If X-engine modification has been performed at OEM as per para . 5.2 ( Modif . at OEM ) , once ready to upgrade , the physical changes would not be reverted on the engine but the paperwork changes would be performed referencing the SI . Logbook update An entry in the logbook is always required when downgrading , upgrading and converting engines at OEM . A new Form 1 will also need to be issued ( QMSP 10-02 ) .

"1 . CBNs produced before 2024 Historical CBNs are on SharePoint A CBN may be replaced by a CAR Supplement . The CBN , CAR Supplement or IA are identiﬁed in the nomenclature of the ﬁles . To ﬁnd the targets , the excel ﬁles must be used . A CBN , CAR Supplement or IA always has an Excel and a PowerPoint . 1.1 SharePoint Structure The SharePoint is composed of folders by program families > programs > CBNs and IAs documentation 1.1.1 Ex . : PT6E-66XT Program Families : Program Families > programs The detailed cost information of the part numbers is present in the “ Detail Costs ” Tab , “ FSC USD ” Column . Some notes on the FSC :  The “ FSC USD ” column is NOT Unit FSC . It ’ s the FSC for the full Qty . The Qty is listed in the “ Qty ” column . A single part may be present on many lines with different quantities .  To properly calculate the target , it is required to consider the USM parts . The USM parts can be identiﬁed using the Level available in the “ Detail Costs ” tab .  A part number may have many vendors ( Dual source )  The vendor information are available from the “ Vendor Code ” and “ Vendor Name ” Column .  The FSC USD is in ReportYear $ . To have a target in CurrentYear $ , the ReportYear $ needs to be escalated using business Case CPI . The business case CPI can be found in “ Finance Summary ” Tab in the row “ Cumulative inﬂation ” .  The CBN and CAR Supplement are snap shots in time that don ’ t change once published . Therefore , the part numbers may have evolved and need to be retraced to the list in the detail cost tab . Ex . : PT6E-66XT CAR Supplement was made in 2020 , all the cost in the “ Detail Cost ” Tab are in 2020 $ . Detail Cost tab 1.2 Calculate Targets There are two main use cases . The ﬁrst one is when we need to ﬁnd a unit FSC Target , the second when we need to ﬁnd the FSC Target for a group of parts i.e . by Vendor , country or Business unit 1.2.1 Use Case 1 : Unit FSC Target 4 steps : 1- Filter on Part Number 2- Conﬁrm if there are USM parts 3- Conﬁrm escalation 4- Calculate unit target cost Ex.1 : Target for ST6317-09 Step 1 : Filter on Part Number In this example , there are many lines for that part number .

Step 2 : Conﬁrm if there are USM parts under the part number that need to be accounted . ( Remove the ﬁlter from the line ) In this example , the 3135911 has children . If the whole assembly needs to be reported for the target , the children need to be considered . However , it ’ s possible the request was for a speciﬁc child . It could be for only the casting , therefore only the casting part number should be considered starting step 1 . Step 3 : Conﬁrm escalation Step 4 : Calculate unit cost * Since there are children , the sum of FSCs of all the children need to be considered . [ Unit Target FSC ( $ 2024 ) ] = sum ( [ FSC USD ( $ 2020 ) ] ) / [ Qty ] * [ Cumulative Escalation ] [ Unit Target FSC ( $ 2024 ) ] = ( 2500.36 $ + 5823 $ + 669.20 ) / 1 * 1.041 [ Unit Target FSC ( $ 2024 ) ] = 9361.25 $ 1.2.2 Use Case 2 : FSC target for a group of parts 2 Steps : 1- Filter on the group of parts 2- Calculate FSC target Ex.1 : Target for a speciﬁc vendor Paradigm Step 1 : Filter on the group of parts ( Vendor Code ) Step 2 : Calculate FSC target * Because we need the target for all the parts from the vendor , we don ’ t need to consider unit FSC [ Unit Target FSC ( $ 2024 ) ] = sum ( [ FSC USD ( $ 2020 ) ] ) * [ Cumulative Escalation ] [ Unit Target FSC ( $ 2024 ) ] = ( $ 775.57 + $ 1,645.85 + $ 684.54 + $ 3,479.18 + $ 744.80 + $ 131.44 ] * 1.041 = 10,520.55 $ 2 .

If you can not answer the above questions , you should not initiate the Scrap . Depends on your role and responsibility , you should get the proper access by raising EPM request for transaction ZMSCRAP ( see How to get access section of this cookbook ) . Study Scrap Type Definition section and the related notes to ensure you have all you need to create the proper scrap form . Go to chosen Scenario based on the scrap type and follow the steps and actions required ( based on role & responsibility ) to create and complete a ZMSCRAP transaction . Note : Technical Liability vs. Commercial Decision QS and MA ’ s responsibility is to provide technical liability in Enovia for EQUEST and EQNs . So , it is basically to determine if the supplier is liable or if the liability is P & WC ’ s ( A & T , Engineering , OEM , etc. ) . QS and MA ’ s responsibility is not to provide commercial decision such as debit or not debit , cost center , dept . no . The Account Specialist is whom to be contacted for commercial decision and relate matters .

This form is supported by PPP 13-01 and SQOP 01-02 . The copy of form is available on the Supplier Portal for download ( Supplier Knowledge Center > Forms folder ) . This form is mandatory for scrapping any material owned by P & WC at a supplier , i.e. , MHS-USM and MHS-RTV ( MHS : Material in hands of supplier ) . The only exception is the scraps for test pieces which are the parts supplier are using for machine setup . Should you have any question or concern , please reach department 5223 ( SM Logistics ) . • • For both MHS-RTV and MHS-USM scraps , the form 10291 should be used as a trigger to raise an associated Scrap form in ZMSCRAP transaction . For test pieces , after confirmation from supplier regarding the quantity of parts scrapped , the Material Planner , or Buyer in charge should raise a Scrap form in SAP ( ZMSCRAP transaction ) with the respective reason code ( 0001 ) unless there is an exemption for specific code ( please refer to ZMScrap cookbook , Scenario E ) . Note : As it is mentioned , Form 10291 is mandatory , except for test pieces . However , if a supplier issued its own scrap certificate it can be used along with the form 10291 only if it contains below 7 points . If so , Material Planner or Buyer can fill a form 10291 on behalf of the supplier and in the signature section ( step 3 ) can write : “ as per attached scrap certificate ” .

Supplier indicates the request is related to which part number ( s ) , Serial Number ( s ) , Purchase Order ( s ) , and enters the related quantity . Supplier chooses the reason for scrap from the drop-down menu available in the form 10291 , adds a supplementary comment if necessary , and also mentions the QN or RFA Number when it is applicable or available .

Suppliers should always wait for P & WC ’ s authorization before scrapping a P & WC-owned material . Therefore , Supplier answers below question as “ NO ” on the form 10291 and pass the form - without signing it - to P & WC ’ s Material Planner , or Account Specialist , or Buyer in order to request for authorization ( see Step 2 ) . B . There are some instances that Supplier already scrapped the part ( s ) before P & WC ’ s authorization , e.g . during machining operations .

The respective technical liability should be chosen from the list . This is the technical liability and has no relation with debiting or not debiting supplier for the scrapped part ( s ) . Where there is no RFA , QN , or no supplier ’ s self-declaration of liability , you can use P & WC . To process the authorization to the supplier , the Material Planner or Buyer should raise a ZMSCRAP form in SAP . Once ZMSCRAP is approved by Value Stream Manager or Manager of approval department ( i.e . when ZMSCRAP form is in STAT4 ) , the Material Planner or Buyer should add ZMSCRAP # on form 10291 and return it to Supplier as an authorization to scrap the part ( s ) . If the supplier answered “ NO ” in step 1 to the question of “ Is it already mutilated ? ” , please request the supplier to mutilate , witness , and sign the step 3 and return the completed form to you before proceed to step 4 .

Mutilated parts should not be able to be reworked or camouflaged to provide the appearance of being serviceable such as , re-plating , shortening and re-threading long bolts , welding , straightening , machining , cleaning , polishing , or repainting . The intent of this requirement is for it to be impossible for the part to be used for its originally intended purpose . Mutilation may be accomplished by one or a combination of the following procedures , but is not limited to : •Grinding . •Burning . •Removal of a major integral feature . •Permanent distortion of parts . •Cutting a significant size hole with a cutting torch or saw . •Melting . •Sawing into many small pieces . •Removing manufacturer ’ s identification , part , lot , batch , and serial numbers .

If stock is in vendor consignment you need to transfer it . If there are less than or equal to 5 parts you need to negotiate with the buyer for the part . If no stock is available you need to enter the order in SAP to create a demand and advise the buyer . 5 Issuing Parts There are two ways to issue parts Either as consignment ( kbn ) or as bulk ( zt8 ) When you issue parts on consignment it will increase the level of inventory that you have at a OEM When you issue parts bulk it will not affect inventory . These are consumable items such as packings , o-rings , seals etc…and must be under $ 250 manufacturing cost . 6 Issuing Parts You will normally receive a request from a PWC OEM FSR , requesting bulk stock . Always for both Bulk and KB orders create new S/O whenever a request comes and do not add it in old S/O Consignment stock will be issued via RFA ’ s or a request on an approved OPM form 6.3 You will process these requests using the transaction VA01 Enter order Type “ OR ” – for Bulk Enter order Type “ KB ” – for consignment Sales organization is always 1000 , Distribution Channel 20 Division is 10 . 7 Issuing Parts Transaction VA01- enter info and hit enter – this is a bulk transaction – for consignment change the OR to KB 8 Issuing Parts On the next screen you will be entering a lot of information .

Progm . ) Demands is a procedure that defines the processes used by OPM to order hardware for production to meet customer commitments . The tool used to accomplish this is NOP Demands . NOP is an independent SAP demand , managed exclusively by OPM , to protect the program against risks . NOPs should only be placed in the case where there are production engines identified to allocate the hardware and only once the NOP is approved in the NOP registry . Originators of NOPs are responsible for the hardware from release of the NOP to when the hardware is consumed . Refer to the OPM intranet page , under Hardware Management Process , for work instructions and cookbooks on placing risk orders and NOPs . NOP Demands Process Flow Mapping NOP request form Requester has to fill the form and send it to gp.pwc.cyient @ pwc.ca for initiation of NOP demands . Headers containing color light blue are mandatory fields and green are important information to be filled by the requestor .

Please make sure you enable the macros when opening the file . NOP Registry : Tracks high level NOP expenditures ( not individual NOP ’ s ) and Manager ’ s approvals . Each line in the NOP Registry can represent hundreds of actual NOP ’ s sharing the same purpose . HSR Form : Formal communication between Procurement and OPM used when NOP ’ s are placed inside Lead Time . Each line in the HSR Form represents an actual NOP in SAP . NOP Registry : File in SharePoint which needs to be checked out and checked in each time it is modified , including when the Managers use it to approve NOP ’ s . HSR Form : It is not a SharePoint file . HSR Forms are created each time there is a need for it . HSR Forms should be saved in SharePoint in order to provide Buyer ’ s approval evidence .

The spreadsheet will generate an Expenditure Number , capture your badge and today ’ s date . It will also assume by default that the NOP Expenditure will happen inside Lead Time and therefore an HSR Form is required . You can change this . Continue to fill out the rest of the information . The spreadsheet will not allow you to submit if some information is missing . Leave this field blank since the Approver will use it to approve the NOP Expenditure . Next step is to fill out an HSR Form if required . An HSR Form is only required if the NOP Expenditure is inside Lead Time .

If some of the NOP ’ s were rejected ( Not Agreed ) by the Approver , you can modify them and send the HSR again to the approver When a change is made ( in this example from 25 to 20 pcs ) the spreadsheet will clear the approval fields automatically . Once Procurement has agreed to your NOP ’ s by answering the HSR or they haven ’ t replied to you after 7 days , you can update the “ HSR Form ” field to Approved . Alternatively , you can update the “ HSR Form ” field to “ Sent ” and the spreadsheet will change it automatically to Approved after 7 days . Next step is to submit your NOP Expenditure for approval by using this button . Notice how the button is linked to the NOP Expenditure where the cursor is .

The tools used to accomplish this are Risks Orders and NOPs . Risk Orders are defined as any engine part that must be ordered to support engine build where the required definition release is not available within leadtime of the part to meet a customer commitment . NOP is an independent SAP demand , managed exclusively by OPM , to protect the program against risks . In addition , this procedure defines the hardware management activities required to procure , build and ship the first production engines between Passport 3 `` Permission to order production hardware '' and Passport 4 '' Permission to deliver serial production '' . OPM has a key role to coordinate and monitor progress of hardware management activities with all organizations involved and address any issues that could jeopardize production engine deliveries . 4.0 Acronyms BMC CO NOP - Bill of Material Change - Change Order - New Ops .

PReq : System-generated requisition resulting from an EMO or Risk Order . Mandatory CO : COs that are required for all production engines ( at P & WC or OEM ) prior aircraft entry into service ( EIS ) . There are two types of such COs : - `` Must All '' - Change must be incorporated on all engines at P & WC ( no engines are delivered at OEM yet ) . - `` Serial # and Mandatory Retrofit '' - Change must be incorporated on all engines at P & WC and OEM . 6.0 Risk Orders Risk orders are to be used to order unsubstantiated hardware as opposed to NOPs which are to be used to order substantiated / production hardware . Where possible , OPM should instruct Supply Chain to deliver current development risk production / purchase orders as Production hardware . Target for OPM is to have zero risk hardware in Development Store . Ordering risk hardware should only be performed when the current part is not acceptable and the new part is necessary for an engine build to meet a program milestone or a customer commitment . Prior to ordering risk hardware , the OPM Manager and OPE must be satisfied that the risk of change to the new configuration prior to CO issue is at an acceptable level , and that the consequences of scrapping the risk hardware due to unforeseen changes is also acceptable . In the absence of a released P & WC drawing , risk hardware can be ordered using a vendor part number , or a similar part number if appropriate instructions on how to manage the differences can be clearly described on a This document is electronically controlled .

They can only be placed in the OEUP ’ s : NOP demands may be used to provide visibility for retrofit requirements until the approved OEUP plan Planned return / conversion engines : NOP demands are required to provide advanced visibility for planned return engine / conversion engine requirements until Logistics load the BMCs and SAP drives the demand . CO / New BS Incorporation : If the material is already loaded in SAP , NOP demands can be used instead of development PReq to support the incorporation of a CO / new derivative BS . In the case of a delayed incorporation , NOPs may be used to drive a temporary demand for the superseded hardware , until the CO is issued . replacement ( s ) . Escape : NOPs placed for replacement hardware due to an escape are to be used only for OEM Short Ship : In the case of a short ship , there will be a CO that removes material from the BOM of the engine ( s ) that are to be short shipped . In the interim time between short shipping the engine and rescinding the short ship through a CO that replaces the material in the BOM , the hardware will be secured through an NOP ( s ) . Audit Engines : In the case of production startup programs , there may be a requirement by Engine Centre Quality to perform multiple audit engines . This process involves building , stripping , inspection ( NDT ) and rebuilding of engines . There are parts that are consumed during these audit engines , for example , nuts , bolts , packings , shrouds , etc . Since SAP will not manage this additional hardware requirement , NOPs can be used to plan this consumable hardware . NOTE : NOPs should only be placed in the case where there are engines identified to allocate the hardware and only once the NOP is approved in the NOP registry . Originators of risk orders and NOPs are responsible for the hardware from release of the development PReq or NOP , to when the hardware is consumed .

Considering that the Integrated Material Flow ( IMF ) group only tracks part deliveries two ( 2 ) months prior engine build , the OPM Planner provides earlier visibility using the Supply Chain Action Required tool ( SCAR ) . This tool essentially shows if POs are placed on time and if parts deliveries are on track . In case of RFNs , LNs and mandatory COs , the impacted parts are integrated in the tool to ensure full visibility on production configuration . Any delivery issue that could affect entry into production is escalated and a recovery plan developed in conjunction with Supply Management , Manufacturing sites and Engineering . In the situation where a Mandatory CO release jeopardize hardware availability , OPM can decide to order risk hardware . Monitoring of CO release is critical to avoid any hardware delivery in experimental . In rare situations , when no recovery plan is possible , delaying the first engines deliveries or moving ahead with pre-production engines ( refer to OPMP 3.11 Industrialization for details ) must be discussed at the PMT and decision taken .

When Cyient receives the OEM Consignment start-up request ( form P & WC 11297 ) , the parts are validated to see if the part is export control restricted . In addition , SAP will flag export control restricted parts . To unblock the part , request ITC to review the export control classification . If the export classification allows shipment , ITC will unblock the delivery / sales order . Parts subject to export control restrictions must be brought up to ITC_OPS to remove the legal control block or until confirmation of license . Otherwise it can not be placed in consignment inventory . The FSR / OEM Consignment Coordinator are the custodians of the consignment inventory list at OEM and are responsible for ensuring that it is kept up to date . Once parts are ordered , the OEM Consignment Coordinator is responsible to track on time delivery of items . The OEM Consignment Coordinator must investigate the need for export control for any of the consignment items ; negotiate the delivery dates of parts if back ordered , with procurement and OPM . This process can be used to add or remove consignment items during the legacy phase of a program . For return of consignment parts , no RFA is required if the part packaging complies with CPW152 ( unopened plastic bag ) and Form 1 is still with the part .

It is OPM ’ s responsibility to manage the inventory exposure at the OEM . Yearly reviews of the inventory are to be launched by OEM Consignment Coordinator to ensure that only usable hardware is in consignment ( i.e . superseded parts have been sent for rework or scrapped ; parts with missing Form 1 are also highlighted ) and that the usage levels are in line with the consignment levels . The OEM Consignment Coordinator will consult with OPE / OPA for parts with missing Form 1 . It is the FSR / OEM Consignment Coordinator ’ s responsibility to maintain the consignment inventory under the agreed targets through weekly or monthly monitoring of inventory reports , fluctuation analysis and reduction proposals . If the inventory targets are to go up , due to unavoidable situations like new parts added , new OEM ’ s added , the OEM Consignment Coordinator will discuss with all the stakeholders to arrive at a revised inventory target .

When deemed necessary , Finance will audit the findings . 8.0 MATERIAL REPLACEMENT AT OEM A P & WC FSR assigned to the OEM will determine the need to replace an engine component . The P & WC FSR will report this event in the RFA system indicating a part removal has occurred and a part replacement is required . Once the RFA is duly completed by the FSR it will be processed . The OEM Consignment Coordinator will query the RFA system pulling in newly created RFA ’ s . These RFA ’ s will be analyzed and processed as required . Should there be inconsistencies between Part Disposition and Part Requirements , OEM Consignment Coordinator is to confirm the requirements with the FSR . Three actions in SAP normally occur when an RFA is processed by the OEM Consignment Coordinator : - A sales order for a part replacement is created ; - A return authorization number is created ; - A reconciling of inventory is done .

In circumstances where the event is of high visibility with escalation to upper management possible , a part can be issued but the Buyer must be informed of this transaction immediately . The OEM Consignment Coordinator will inform the FSR of the delivery status of the replacement hardware and attach the return document for the removed hardware disposition ( RMA ) . If part TTSN is 50 hours and more or if RFA is C of A “ issued ” , confirmation email is sent to FSR and CQM prior processing return ( RMA ) . If the replacement hardware is back ordered , the OEM Consignment Coordinator will send an email to the Buyer copying the P & WC FSR and OPM requesting a promised delivery date . Should a P & WC FSR not have access to the RFA system and require a component , they may phone in their request to the OEM Consignment Coordinator at the contact numbers that have been supplied to them . The request will be processed as “ RFA TBA ” and adjusted once the RFA number is supplied by the P & WC FSR once created . The OEM Consignment Coordinator will inform the CQM of this transaction . The P & WC FSR must return to P & WC in a reasonable time frame ( within 90 days ) the removed component so that P & WC Quality can investigate the reason for removal . The P & WC FSR can also request consumable part replacements via the email address : GP.PWC.Oemconsignment @ pwc.ca . 9.0 SCRAP ON SITE AT THE OEM The P & WC FSR is the first person contacted by the OEM for engine troubleshooting . The P & WC FSR will assess each situation and determine the appropriate course of action and document the event in the RFA system . The assessment and determination of the appropriate course of action may be supported by P & WC Quality , Engineering , Engine Centre ( ATTS ) and other P & WC departments as required .

Parts that require an investigation or are repairable , are to be returned to P & WC via the normal RFA process , as per section 8.0 on Material replacement at OEM . Parts that can be scrapped on site are the following : various consumables ( Appendix A ) ; parts where no investigation report is expected by the OEM ; hardware that the supplier has no interest in investigating the parts . Serialized components to be scrapped and other parts that can not be scrapped at OEM , should be returned to P & WC . This document is electronically controlled .

The P & WC FSR ensures that the parts are mutilated as per P & WC policy ( QMSP 08-03-02 and QMSP 08-03- 07 ) so that they can not be returned to service . The parts are to be disposed of in the local scrap bin of either the P & WC Service Center or the OEM . When the P & WC FSR is not sure if a part should be returned to P & WC or not , they should ask the assigned P & WC Customer Quality Manager or Project Manager . In the event of any doubt by the P & WC FSR or a delay in receiving a reply from P & WC , the part should always be returned to P & WC . In certain cases , the P & WC Customer Quality Manager and /or Project Manager may request that the part not be returned but a picture of the part may be added to the RFA for a visual record of the defect .

Inspection Priority / Issue at inspection A= Available Note : When required , OPA/ OPE/ Planner will escalate to Supply Chain , to achieve delivery dates . If necessary , involve Engineering to adjust requirements to achieve target dates . In the situation where the procurement process is started too late following delays in drawings ' release , it is the responsibility of Engineering to initiate actions that will expedite deliveries . The OPM organization provides support whenever possible to define and execute recovery plans with Canadian Manufacturing sites and Supply Chain NPI teams . EXAMPLES : paying expedite fees , considering alternate manufacturing methods ( MED , SLA Casting etc ) , creating cifers to waive requirements / allow material substitution , etc . Maintain DNA with the latest input from shortage meeting For unique parts : Drive drawing release with Engineering Upon receipt of Engineering Change Notification ( Adv . Release ) raise Job Ticket based on quantity and delivery date agreed upon by OPE / OPA or Project Engineering . Follow up on Job Ticket until source is awarded . Change the status in HDWP / DNA-Report to reflect that Job Ticket is complete ( Source has been awarded ) When the source is awarded , a notification email will be sent to both Project Engineering and Planner . Tip 1 : Ensure Planner registers to EC Notification for the program to receive emails when drawing is Advanced Release Tip 2 : Follow Job Ticket cookbook for detailed steps on Job Ticket creation to closure Raise EMO with all mandatory info . including valuable comments for the Buyer or colleagues i.e . What 's happening with this P/N such as : - Quotation reference - If USM , reference details to be supplied - Buyer name and code ( from Job Ticket ) - Sign and date text Seek required approvals When EMO is fully approved ( DE 's responsibility ) , check for Serialization , ESA , Storage Loc. , USM/VSM , etc .

Buyer will validate with their supplier and reply back via email to confirm if change can be fully incorporated or not . 2 . The OPM planner must closely monitor to obtain the buyer 's response given that the WIP is impacted . Turn around for a response is 2 to 3 business days . 3 . Once the response is received from the buyer , add a note with PO number , date of the email from buyer and the confirmation if change can be incorporated in the PLM Mandatory revision route . 4 . Once the Mandatory revision route is accepted by the rest of the team ( DE , PE , Drafting ) a drawing approval route can start to issue the accepted change . 5 . The OPM planner must make sure to be informed as soon as the new design is released by being added to the drafting distribution list or subscribe in PLM to the specific drawing . 6 . Once the new Mandatory Revision is issued , Planner must amend the existing P Req to update the latest revision letter in SAP ZEMM the change for the mandatory change . 7 .

These R/H orders are to be used to start procurement of unsubstantiated hardware as opposed to New Operations Program ( NOP ) demand which are to be used to order substantiated or Production hardware ( Ref . : OPMWI 4.11.1 NOP Demand ) . OPM instructs Supply Management ( SM ) to not deliver R/H in Development plant 0102 , but to transfer the Purchase Order ( PO ) to a Production PO as soon as possible when demand is loaded in Production plant . The target for OPM is to have no R/H delivered in Development Store . This is to avoid receiving part without completed PPAP packages and then transferring these parts to Production plant with incomplete PPAP . Risk Hardware is not to be used as buffer stock which should be raised by Supply Management in the Production environment . Why raise Risk Hardware Orders Ordering R/H can only occur when the current part configuration is not acceptable or new parts are necessary for an engine build to meet the program milestone or a customer commitment . On NPI programs , the R/H order is mostly used to initiate procurement activities for long lead time item to secure New Program Introduction ( NPI ) . Typically , OPM may choose to order bearings , forgings , castings , etc . CIFER parts are not considered for Risk Hardware as they can not be transferred to Production as such without a part number change . The OPE / OPA ensures to fill Risk Hardware Order Assessment & Justifications ( P & WC form 12405 ) and seeks approval .

The OPM Planner must ensure that the quote is still valid ( development or production quote if available ) . The quantity of parts to be ordered must cover the lead time for raw material and final part processing to ensure meeting program target . Business Rules : Non-Recurring Expenses ( NRE ) and tooling are not paid by OPM via Risk Hardware but are paid by Engineering . A “ text item PO ” initiated with “ Element ” type in ZEMM , can be considered for these exceptional situations : Launch VSM raw material , details at suppliers for very long lead time part . The “ Text item PO ” raised in Plant 0102 must be cancelled as soon as the PO can be placed on the top assembly PN ; Expedite fees are typically not paid by OPM . However , if OPM negotiates and agrees to pay . Risk Hardware Order Justification Form Minimal amount : to be discussed is it 10K for the same Project , or other amount ( TBD ) In order to manage the R/H budget , the OPE / OPA initiates approvals of form 12405 via Quick flow in SharePoint ( Setting QuickFlow - Approval Guide ) and ensures that form is fully approved .

For Legacy programs , the OPM Manager and the OPE / OPA evaluate the risk associated of the new configuration of the PN prior the issue of the Change Order ( CO ) . A risk mitigation plan must be in place to evaluate the consequences of potentially scrapping the R/H material due to unforeseen changes of the new design .

Who approves the Risk Hardware in ZEMM Once the Risk Hardware Purchase Requisition ( PReq ) is raised , it must be approved by the following departments / job functions : P2 OPE / OPA or OPM Manager - < $ 1K P3 Finance – < $ 10K P4 OPM Manager – < $ 50K P5 Executive – > $ 50K Note : The notification that an approval is required is done via email communications , as there is no workflow , but the approval is done in SAPP ZEMM transaction . OPM Planner sends an email to ensure approvals for all the required levels . In the email you must specify the Network that is used to ensure the approver has the complete information . The rationale for raising the R/H must also be in the email to facilitate approval . Text from form 12405 can be used for justification . How to assign PReq to Supply Management Once the PReq for the R/H is fully approved , please see Section 8 . The process is the same as the approval of the Engineering Material Order ( EMO ) in SAP . Once completed come back to Section 6.8 below . Sending email to Supply Management OPM Planner must send an email to the Supply Management team to inform them that they must use a unique PO for the Risk Hardware . This is traceability of the communication with Supply Management team . Cancelling the Risk Hardware Except in cases which are duly justified , R/H can not be shipped to Development ( plant 0102 ) . The R/H PO needs to be cancelled once the Production demand is loaded in the Production schedule for NPI programs or when the Change Order is loaded in Production Plant . This is done by communicating with SM to convert the Development PO to a Production PO . Then the Risk Hardware PReqs must be cancelled in ZEMM . The R/H must be cancelled with an explanation note added in the “ Miscellaneous",OPMWI_4_11_2_RH_Mgmt_EMO_Processing_Cookbook_WEB.docx,OPMWI_4_11_2_RH_Mgmt_EMO_Processing_Cookbook_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/04_Hardware/Risk_Hardware/OPMWI_4_11_2_RH_Mgmt_EMO_Processing_Cookbook_WEB.docx
"Production demand is loaded in the Production schedule for NPI programs or when the Change Order is loaded in Production Plant . This is done by communicating with SM to convert the Development PO to a Production PO . Then the Risk Hardware PReqs must be cancelled in ZEMM . The R/H must be cancelled with an explanation note added in the “ Miscellaneous tab ” in the text section for documentation purpose , with signature , title , phone and date : Once the note is added , the R/H can be cancelled by selecting the line and clicking on the canister at the top . The Risk Hardware will appear as such in ZEMM with the cancellation flag in red . Transferring Risk Hardware from Development to Production On exceptional occasions , when for example the CO is not released as per plan , the R/H can be delivered to plant 0102 . Once the CO is released , ensure transfer of material to Production plant as per cookbook : ZAPD- Transferring Experimental Material to Production The complete PPAP package must be available prior to transferring when PPAP applies as per Enovia . Part must demonstrate as evidence at least a PPAP package in process , plus a deferral form 1 in ASQR-09.2 prepared by Supply Management . Part number Quality Level must comply to QMSP 07-05-02 . For more information refer to : PPP 07-05 PPAP and PPP 15-06 Transfer of Experimental Parts to Production Decision Process for Material that can not be Transferred to Production UNDER CONSTRUCTION In the exceptional situation , that parts are delivered to P & WC , and can not be transferred to Production Plant , …… .

It contains information about the Risk Hardware status : approved , PO not placed , PO placed , date or receipt of parts and maintenance instructions . OPM Planners are responsible to : Ensure R/H is approved Allocated to buyer PO is placed Follow on R/H part status Monitor CO loading in Production plant Cancel the R/H when Production Order is in place Consult the Report and take actions to minimize inventory Processing Engineering Material Order ( EMO ) OPM Planners have the mandate to assign the approved EMO to Supply Management as per Account Specialists / Material Planners List . Engineering will advise OPM once the EMO is fully approved . OPM Planner can assign to Supply Management based on the Supplier that will manufacture the part . This is done in SAP with ZEMM transaction . To facilitate the retrieval of pending EMO , please refer to Appendix 1 on how to create a variant and Appendix 2 how to retrieve a variant . How to retrieve Purchase Requirements Another method , when the network is communicated by Engineering , is to go directly to the network identified in the email : Identify Project definition number to retrieve Purchase Requirements (",OPMWI_4_11_2_RH_Mgmt_EMO_Processing_Cookbook_WEB.docx,OPMWI_4_11_2_RH_Mgmt_EMO_Processing_Cookbook_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/04_Hardware/Risk_Hardware/OPMWI_4_11_2_RH_Mgmt_EMO_Processing_Cookbook_WEB.docx

How to retrieve Purchase Requirements Another method , when the network is communicated by Engineering , is to go directly to the network identified in the email : Identify Project definition number to retrieve Purchase Requirements ( PReq ’ s ) by model ; This example is for the PW210E Program – A “ variant ” can also be created by program . Identify Purchasing Group X90 which represents the OPM group as a default for all new PReq ’ s generated and X91 which represents changes that have been made to the original PReq . Once fully approved , those will need to be assigned to SM so they are able to issue a Purchase Order ; Click execute button . How to assign a Purchase Requisition to Supply Chain To assign or allocate an approved PReq to a Buyer , follow these steps . Material Tab Ensure the Change Letter / Drawing revision letter is in accordance with drawing released in Enovia . Note : Verify Enovia for steps 1-2-3-4 in Part Properties – Part number Object or SPD / SMD in the Spec & Documents tab . Serialized box is automatically checked when applicable ( reads from Enovia ) . ESA is only checked off if SPD requires it . All new part numbers created in Enovia , are now automatically flagged UPPAP ( reads from Enovia ) . Therefore , if a part is not going to be purchased as the production source Supplier ( Ex : MED Shop ) or if the configuration of the part is cifered ( ex . : 01X P/N ) you would have to remove the check mark before saving PReq . In some instances UPPAP may be removed following an IPT decision on Development hardware . Contact the OPE / OPA for confirmation . Material Master Sourcing ( Purchased , UB Order , Manufactured ) : If the source needs to be changed from Purchased to Manufactured or vice versa , request the change from Engineering Material Management team at email : GP.PWC.MATREMM @ pwc.ca If the source needs to be changed to UB order , refer to the SAP COOKBOOKS FOR PLANNERS on the OPM Intranet . Qty & Dates Tab Review that Req ’ d Date is in line with the overall program requirements based on the Level 2 plan and negotiate delivery dates with Supply Chain if required . Check that quantity , price and currency are in line with quotation . Miscellaneous Tab IMPORTANT : For castings , ensure the “ Identified As ” reflects the applicable material specification as shown on drawing .

Validate that Storage Location is correct ( reads Material Master ) . Ensure to enter valuable comments that can help the Buyer or your colleagues identify what is happening with this part number i.e . Quotation reference , If USM , reference details to be supplied ( Refer to Appendix C ) , Sign and date text , If Preq is deleted or amended , provide a name , reason and date for who requested it . Once all three tabs have been verified and amended accordingly , click on the Save button . Once all required approvals are obtained , assign appropriate PReq Buyer Code ( SAP ZEMM or ME52N ) . Refer to Account Specialists / Material Planners List that can be found on the Intranet under Operations , then Supply Management Input material ordered USM to support assembly at Supplier The OPM NPI Planner has the responsibility to track and make available the input material to make the assemblies ordered by Engineering . Input material are : castings , forgings , standards parts , etc. , that the Supplier will need to deliver for the development parts on order . When viewing requisitions , OPM needs to determine if any details are to be ordered / supplied to produce the finished part ( USM ) . Go to the ZEMM Workbench , select the component you want to add items to . Material Tab In the Material Tab , under the highlighted line , add your detail part number and review all the same rules as indicated on previous section “ 8.2 How to assign a PReq to Supply Chain ” . Update the Material Master with appropriate Buyer code Once the PReq is assigned to Supply Chain , ensure Material Master reflects relevant Purchasing Group ( Buyer code ) . This is not mandatory but a best practice . There are two transactions that can perform this action . MM02 transaction The target is to process PReq ’ s within 2 working days once full cost approval is obtained and drawings are available .

"ORDERING & SHIPPING NON-PRODUCT MATERIAL TO FIELD SERVICE MANAGERS ( FSM ) Introduction : In the past , I have been asked ( rarely ) by FSMs to provide non-product material such as borescope , cart to carry engines in confined areas and chemical products like coating or paint bottle for touch ups at OEM . The following cookbook mainly covers chemical products since they should be listed in SAP . If you must order other items than chemical products , start at Step 3. of this cookbook with the SRM shopping cart . Receive request from FsM for CHEMICAL productS needed at OEM . For Chemical products , the FSM will often only give you the PMC number like PMC 9748 – Coating , Aluminum or PMC 79571 – Lubricating Compound . In SAP there is a “ L ” or “ LC ” or “ C ” prefix added to the PMC number and there is no space between PMC and the number . Examples : LPMC9748 – Coating , Aluminum / LCPMC79571 – Lubricating Compound Search via SAP – MD04 – Material field : Ordering material to be shipped . Once you find the SAP Material number and matching description , you search available material via MMBE in all plants . There are cases where material is readily available in the following locations : Plant 1 – Master Crib ( 1M ) – Extn . 7-1680 Plant 5 – Master Crib ( 5M ) – Ext . 5-4006 Plant 5 – Paint Shop – Ext . 5-3339 ( Master crib person will tell you ) . If material is in another plant , ask Storekeeper to transfer it to Plant 1 – Shipping Dept . with your name as Contact point , for you to be able to ship it to the OEM location where FSM needs to perform the work . If material is not showing as available in SAP , contact the MRP Controller to know if a SRM shopping cart should be completed to order it . You will need the price , the unit of measure , country of manufacture , HS Code and the lead time required . You will need this info . in the SRM Shopping Cart and Shipping Order request ( Form 1211 ) . Some of this info can be found in the MM03 – Purchase Order Text tab . RAISING SRM SHOPPING CART FOR NON-PRODUCT MATERIAL ( IF NOT IN STOCK ) Refer to the Indirect Supply Chain web page for all information related to SRM Access request and Cookbooks : Login to the P & WC Portal : https : //eportal.pwc.ca/irj/portal and select Create Shopping Cart . Click on PWC Non-Product Catalogue if material is listed in SAP . If not listed , click on Describe what you need . Enter Material number – Quantity ( based on unit of measure ) – Delivery date based on lead time . When you get to this window , click on the link in the “ Description ” field .",Ordering_Shipping_NonProduct_Matl_FSM_WEB.docx,Ordering_Shipping_NonProduct_Matl_FSM_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/04_Hardware/Planners_Cookbooks/Ordering_Shipping_NonProduct_Matl_FSM_WEB.docx
"Shopping Cart . Click on PWC Non-Product Catalogue if material is listed in SAP . If not listed , click on Describe what you need . Enter Material number – Quantity ( based on unit of measure ) – Delivery date based on lead time . When you get to this window , click on the link in the “ Description ” field . It will bring you to this window with multiple tabs . Here are the information to be filled in . Item Data : No input required . Account Assignment : Enter percentage ( typically 100 % ) , select Cost Center ( dept . ) or Order ( I.O . ) and enter number accordingly . Historically , I have entered the OPM dept . responsible for the program supported by the requesting FSM . Note and Attachments : You can enter an Internal note for the Master Crib to bring your material to Shipping dept . once you will have sent them the Form 1211 – Request for Shipping Order . Delivery Address/Performance Location : No input required . Availability : The MRP Controller should have given you the lead time required to receive this material . If not , contact this person to know the earliest date possible . Once all required tabs are completed , you can submit your Shopping Cart . It is important to add an “ Approval Note ” for the approvers/storekeepers to know what this Shopping Cart is about . Once you submit it , you can no longer change the name of the shopping cart nor change information contained . Approval Process Overview tab : Here is the before and after approval view of this tab . Related Documents tab : Once approved you will find the following info . for reference . Once the material is available in the Master Crib ( 1M ) or is received at Shipping from another plant . You should provide them with the Form 1211 – Request for Shipping Order . Completing Form 1211 – Request for Shipping Order Here are two examples of completed Forms 1211 with all the data input in blue . Follow carefully the instructions included in page 4 to 6 of this form . Ensure you have validated the contact information with the FSM . Helpful tips on Form 1211 completion : SECTION II . WHAT IS IT ? Quantity – Via MM03 – check Purchase Order Text tab to view “ FORMAT ” provided . E. Unit Value USD – Ensure to convert the SAP price from CAD to USD in the form 1211 . G. If the HS Code is not in SAP-MM03 under the “ Foreign Trade : Import ” tab , contact the MRP Controller and he/she should know or help you completing Form 11910 – HTS Classification Request and send it to hts.classification @ pwc.ca .

"Placing a UB order on Serialized Items from Production to Development CookBook for OPM and DPM/CIA Placing an EMO UB order for serialized item from Production Setting Qty & Dates ( Warning message ) What is happening with serialized items In production , there is a classifying field set into the Material Master which could be very useful when we build an engine and for the tracking of all serialized items of an engine build . In production and development , this field is not necessary when we order the items as a purchased order . In general , both production and development MM parts have the same parameter set . For a UB order form production for a quantity greater than 1 piece and facilitate the transfer , OPM will have to request to change one parameter into MM of the PL0102 to solve the situation .

The transfer requirements are :   Transfer is only permitted for items under quarantine with an ESA Designated status ; no other reasons will be processed . Material transfer to experimental is restricted to Bill of Materials ( BOM ) items associated with the engine model relevant to the Elevate project . See appendix A for the engine model . 7.3 Virtual Transfer from Quarantine to Experimental Store When the quantity to be transferred matches a quantity of an inspection lot , the quarantine inspector needs to update the lot with the transfer request information , close all the inspection tasks from the production lot , perform the usage decision and virtually transfer the material to the experimental store ( Mvt 351 ) . When the quantity requested for the transfer is less than the quantity from an inspection lot , the quarantine inspector needs only to update the lot with the transfer request and virtually transfer the requested quantity to experimental store .

"to create a purchase requisition for R & D purchases . The business employee will fill a requisition in SAP ( ZEMM ) and the system will generate an automatic number . Then , the employee will call the Engineering Finance team to approve the EMO number generated by SAP . The process of authorization ZEMM requisition , even if managed in the system , is not protected enough from unauthorized changes without of being detected . There is a possibility in the system to change the order line items on the requisition , within the order amount limits , without re-initiating the released strategy . Additionally there was no mitigation control before December 5th , 2019 to detect such modifications like a report which would have presented all the amended changes on requisitions . Therefore there is a risk of mistaken / unauthorized changes in the approved requisition without being detected . The issue is self-raised by the entity as it were disclosed to audit team during the audit field work . 6 Issue description Export Classification : [ No Technical Data ] 2018 Engineering ACA Demand sheet ( # 3738 ) raised with IT to develop an audit report that would give visibility on discrepancies between Engineering need approved in ZEMM and Preq in SAP ( related to split of Preq that OPM Planners have access to perform ) . A warning messages will be displayed when there in an intend to split an approved EMO . A pop up message will inform the requestor that they are not allowed to split unless a specified exceptions is selected from a drop down menu Develop work instruction for OPM in order to restrict and clearly document when a split can be performed and when it is not allowed . ( target date : Q4 2019 ; owner : OPM , supported by Engineering Finance ) Testing the new functionality when step 1 is completed ( target date Q4 2019 ; owner : Engineering Finance , OPM Planning and IT ) Develop a control activity ( to be added to SOX matrix ) : once step 1 will be completed , the report will be used to control , on a regular basis , the requisitions that were created from ZEMM to ensure that the purchases are aligned and comply with the NEW ENGINEERING FINANCE CONTROLS . 7 Recommendation Export Classification : [ No Technical Data ] Action plan Objective : Ensure there is formal guidance on when it is acceptable to perform a SPLIT EMO .

This scope is led by the Program Industrialization Manager with the support of a cross-functional team . By default , the initial POC selection at PIR1 will be all the unique to the program parts as well as the common parts ( legacy ) having recurrent producibility issues . The initial POC selection should be provided by the Program Industrialization Manager to OPM and program engineering to ensure that these parts can be included as part of the scope of the program and budgeted accordingly as part of the Operations Start-Up Budget and Engineering Cost Estimate ( ECE ) budget at P1 . Then between PIR1 and PIR1.5 , and after the P & WC contract award is confirmed by the customer ( “ The Program Go '' ) , a revised POC Selection needs to be defined . The scope of this selection is determined by a set of POC criteria ( Ref . WIM 693 and WIM 1048 ) and is reviewed between the Program Industrialization Manager , Manufacturing Engineering as well as Operations Program Management . Thereby , the scope will converge to a reduced list of POCs . This list of POCs becomes the industrialization scope and it will be used for performing the PR deliverable assessment at the program and producer level using form 12284 .

"NPI cycle and until Passport 5 is completed , the Dynamic POC process ( Ref . Figure 5 ) will review the industrialization scope ( list of POCs ) of all programs at a minimum on a quarterly basis . This review will be governed by the production readiness organization and by getting input from various organization ( Supply Management , OPM , Engineering , Aftermarket ) . This dynamic POC approach starts with the industrialization risk analysis of all PN contained in all NPI programs ensures that no major risk is generated by a part not initially categorized as a POC , e.g . recurring quality history , new supplier introduction . Throughout the dynamic POC process , POC will be added and some would be removed based on their industrialization risk level ( PN with more risk are kept as POC ) . The list of identified POCs by program , including the Industrialization Project Manager assignments , is maintained in the PR Deliverable assessment tool . This list is maintained by the Program Industrialization Manager and the Industrialization Project Manager . POC can also be added or removed whenever required . In addition , upon the review and update of the POC list , the PR Manager reviews the capacity planning of the PR organization to ensure the capacity level of the organization can support the PR activities for all the selected POCs , and all NPI programs .

Once the initial PR deliverable assessment is done , the PR review cycle will start with the support of the various business attendees . The Producer PR reviews allow the IPM/PIAM to understand the applicable PR scope for this specific POC , to get an accurate understanding of the POC maturity and to define the required actions to fulfill the gaps .

Table of content REVISION LOG DEFINITION & RULES ACCESSING SRM INTRANET PAGE SRM COOKBOOKS CREATING A SHOPPING CART SHOPPING CART STATUS MORE SRM INFORMATION REVISION LOG Initial issue Revisions issued DEFINITION & RULES An SRM shopping cart is a request to obtain approval for funds to procure a non-product good or service . Non-Product Goods : Material/hardware ( ex : coupons , test bars , specimens , flight instrumentation , etc . ) that are not part of a development or production BOM . Non-Product Service : Special testing such as endurance testing , icing tests , etc . where parts will NOT be sent to service provider , and then be returned , and later be introduced to development or production BOM . For example we will not create purchase orders for a supplier to do a coating on a part ( the coating is a service done on a part ) . Non-Product will manage the creation of a purchase order to a service provider who will do special testing , and who will not be sending any parts back to P & WC . They will only be sending a test report back . Note that if any material gets sent to these suppliers to do such testing , it is managed by end-user . Non-Product does not manage any shipments or allocations to suppliers . A fully approved SRM shopping cart is required before a supplier can deliver the good or service . Once SRM is fully approved , SAP Purchase Requisition will get automatically created . Purchase Order then gets created by Non-Product Buyer in Accenture within 5 to 10 working days . Everyone with a `` Shopper '' Role can raise a shopping cart . All users must refer to MMP355 – Requisitioning Non-Product Goods and Services before creating a Shopping Cart .

OPM identifies production and OEM tooling and gauging requirements with the incumbent services and secures capital funding required for the production start-up investments . The PT6C-67A Tilt Rotor engine program has been developed to support Leonardo ’ s requirements for the AW609 aircraft . The engine is a derivative of the PT6C-67E and PT6C-67C engines , with the unique ability to run in both horizontal and vertical modes . The engine will be certified in Q3 2017 , with the aircraft certification date forecasted for 2018 . Consequently , production start-up will begin in Q1 2018 , with the first production deliveries scheduled for June 2018 . Planned production volumes are expected to ramp up to annual quantities of 20 engines per year by 2019 . This CAR is being raised for permission to procure the following tooling and gauging in support of the PT6C-67A production startup : Engine Centre tooling including assembly , pre-dress , test and vane ring crib tooling Campus 1 and 41 production tooling & gauging OEM tooling Current situation Since the beginning of the program P & WC has delivered 6 customer engines , built in the development environment .

Hardware was damaged . Will necessitate dev support for KF0003 and KF0004 Negative Development ( 1 ) Validation of tooling was done with used parts . Conditions are not the same with new parts . Since this assembly is so delicate , a couple of trials should have been done with NEW parts At the end of the day , development need to ensure that validation is done in similar conditions than production ( 2 ) Development and validation of PT pack tool were done too late in the process . There was not enough time to ensure that the installation process was robust . Furthermore production was unable to obtain their controller on time for KF0001 & KF0002 ( 3 ) Once controller was made available , trials indicated that the PT pack tool was not heating enough in the critical areas . This might explains why hardware was damaged on KF0001 . Tool provided to Engine Centre was not production ready . ( 4 ) Conditions to confirm good installation of PT pack was not clear enough in the AFS . Even with dev support on the floor , decision was made to apply load on the assembly creating damages to parts as the PT pack was not properly seated . A zoom-in picture was added to better show the protrusion of the shaft required to confirm a proper seating of the PT pack 19 PT6C-67A NPI C St-Arneault 2019-06-17 00:00:00 Build Unable to achieve the right angle with the TMS for the PT nut on KF0002 . Multiple trials done using 5 different nuts without success . Addition of oil on the face of the nut was required to complete the operation .

TOL might need to be changed if the addition of oil is required . ( 2 ) This issue observed on KF0002 might be linked to active escape 18EQP00312 . This escape is associated to the PT shaft assembly since 11 production and 2 experimental PT shaft were scrap due to over torque plus one experimental engine released to test cell without adequate torque for the given angle of turn .

Plan was therefore to perform the PFMEA in production on KF0001 . Unfortunately , this was not possible as the engine was extremely late because of major shortages . Decision was made to postpone PFMEA on engine KF0003 or KF0004 . 36 PT6C-67A NPI C St-Arneault 2019-06-17 00:00:00 Test TATP required because slave EEC not functionnal .

Negative Engineering It was indicated that this was never seen in development probably because the engine run hotter than in production . This assumption should probably not apply on the EI validation engine in Q1 2019 ? Need to understand why we did not see this issue at that time ? Actions are required by Program to correct this issue : Oil datum procedure to be revised .

For the engine build and test sourcing strategy , OPM organizes a meeting with all stakeholders to determine the location where the new engine will be assembled and tested . At the same meeting , the decision whether or not sub-assemblies Assembly Method Document ( AMD ) are needed and where they will be sourced is taken . Dual sourcing needs are also discussed and agreed upon . Criteria that can drive this decision are capacity , overall manufacturing strategy , OEM requirements , etc .. products for other programs . For components ( or parts ) of the engine , and in order to establish the FSC baseline in the CBN , the Product Cost group identifies the most likely sources based on current sourcing of similar The OPE / OPA organizes a meeting with the stakeholders to review and validate the basic program sourcing strategy of the Key Components ( refer to OPMP 5.10 for complete list of characteristics ) using the sourcing template and the form P & WC 11895 Program Sourcing Strategy Sheet . The main objectives are : 1 . Demonstrate compliance to Contractual obligations and Partnerships ; 2 .

At the component level , the study will target certain part families ( e.g . bearings , seals , complex castings , critical rotating forgings and turbine blades ) per MMP 348 . For a new centerline , the OPE / OPA organizes a meeting with all stakeholders to define and recommend a Components Program Dual Sourcing Strategy ( ref . form P & WC 11908 ) . For a derivative engine , a ROM can be established based on MFA from Supply Chain and Engineering . Results are recorded in form P & WC 11895 - Program Sourcing Strategy Sheet . The component dual sourcing investments required for a derivative or new centerline program are included in the ECE . Final decision will be taken at Passport 1 . 7.4 Program Operations Risks Management Identifying operational risks early in a program is key to allow proper planning , control and timely decision making to meet customer commitments . Throughout the life of the program , the OPE / OPA drives the process of identifying and assessing risks , establishing mitigation plans and driving actions to closure . For a new centerline prior Passport 0 , identification of risks and mitigation plans is started during the Program Strategic Sourcing meeting with the input received from Operations Strategy , Manufacturing units , Engineering and Supply Chain . The OPE / OPA also requests feedback from the Producibility group and Engine Centre . All operational risks are consolidated into a single file and evaluated in terms of likelihood and impact . The top operational risks are fed into the Program Risk Cube managed by Engineering . The OPE / OPA monitors and update the list of risks throughout the life of the program ensuring to drive mitigation actions to closure . In case of a derivative engine , the same process is followed . However feedback from Operations Strategy , Engineering and Supply Chain is obtained on an individual basis since there is no Program Strategic Sourcing meeting held .

In the event any clarifications or questions arise related to export control , the reader is requested to consult their departmental International Trade Compliance focal point . 3.0 Scope The scope of this procedure is to describe Operations Program Management ( OPM ) role in achieving a successful industrialization of a new program . OPM is responsible for Production readiness process for the transition of components , engines ( including APUs ) and powerplants from proposal through serial production ( MMP 219 , MMP 220 ) . OPM strives for each program to deliver a producible product that is sourced to meet program objectives of cost , yield , quality , schedule and Change Order effectivity . As soon as an MPI request is raised by Marketing to study a new program , OPM takes an active role in defining : NPI Operations Budget , the Program sourcing strategy and risks , the Level 2 Operations plan and the Operations PDRS as explained in OPMP 3.10 Industrialization - Pre-P0 up to P2 . Once the Product Proposal phase is completed , the Definition , Validation and Delivery phases start , typically covering activities from Passport 2 - Permission to Continue Detail Design to Passport 4 - Permission to Deliver Serial Production . This procedure defines the roles and responsibilities of OPM during these industrialization execution phases . 4.0 Acronyms AFS APU AQP A & T BS Assembly Floor Sheet Auxiliary Power Unit Airworthiness Quality Plan Assembly and Test Build Specification This document is electronically controlled .

Project Engineering raises multiple Design Projects ( DP ) to design and substantiate each engine component part of a module . Integrated Product Teams ( IPTs ) are used to execute and monitor the progress of DPs . The goal is to release a configuration to trigger procurement actions and allow substantiation activities . As Operations ' representative , the OPE / OPA takes an active role in various Engineering IPTs and in the Product Management Team ( PMT ) . During the IPTs , OPM 's mandate is to understand the Module definition progress and highlight any potential operational risks that could jeopardize development milestones and / or entry into production . In case of a derivative engine , the OPE / OPA can consult the PCOR and available quality reports of the base model to understand associated risks . At this early stage , involvement of Manufacturing Analyst is critical to assess producibility aspects . The OPE / OPA also supports any demand requiring Operations ' feedback such as sourcing , lead times , capacity , etc . During the PMT , the OPE / OPA provides a high level development material status . It typically includes : top pacer parts on order , pending Engineering Material Orders ( EMOs ) and definition release dates required for unreleased parts . The accuracy and timely availability of the EBOM / CBOM are essential for proper hardware management in DTIS .

"required for unreleased parts . The accuracy and timely availability of the EBOM / CBOM are essential for proper hardware management in DTIS . If these criteria are not met , the situation shall be escalated at the PMT to ensure we achieve an accurate hardware control and meet program milestones . The PMT is the forum to communicate any concerns on the Program Development progress that can result in missing operational and customer commitments in terms of cost , schedule , producibility or quality . The OPE / OPA is responsible to communicate the overall program status provided in the PMT , to Operations ' organizations ( Canadian Manufacturing sites , Supply Management , Engine Centres , etc . ) when deemed necessary . expected at the IPT and PMT levels . Note : Refer to the MMP 219 , Appendix H to obtain a more detailed list of key Operations deliverables 8.2 Key Development Engineering Activities Development Engineering has the mandate of building and testing development and customer engines . They issue and maintain the program test plan ( Development Level 2 Plan ) that documents each test required to certify the program . They also load the EBOM / CBOM into DTIS and adjust the parts list as required to obtain the specific configuration of each development engine required . This document is electronically controlled .

Per EOP 257 , they are responsible for Development Production Readiness process . This is the foundation of the Assembly and Test ( A & T ) production readiness activities for which OPM is responsible , as described in Production Readiness Section 13 . The involvement of the OPE / OPA is therefore essential to ensure that key activities such as Discrepancies Report ( DR ) closure plan , Development Process Failure Mode Effect Analysis ( PFMEA ) , tooling and Assembly Floor Sheet ( AFS ) validation and test cell readiness , are progressing per plan during development phase . 8.3 Development Configuration Management In order to accelerate the procurement cycle , advance release drawings are usually issued ahead of the DP closure . This allows OPM to initiate the hardware procurement activities as described in the following section .

"Development Configuration Management In order to accelerate the procurement cycle , advance release drawings are usually issued ahead of the DP closure . This allows OPM to initiate the hardware procurement activities as described in the following section . Any fit , form or function changes affecting released parts will result in a new part number or Mandatory Revision Letter ( ref . CMM sections C7 and B9 ) . Temporary part numbers can also be used to trigger procurement actions ( ref . ECOP 07-03-02 ) . To facilitate hardware management , Engineering needs to produce Design Intent Documents ( DID ) on all DPs as early as possible in order to obtain a formal EBOM in Product Lifecycle Management ( PLM ) . To minimize risk of delays , first release of EBOM shall be targetted between CDR and FER . As the design evolves , multiple versions of EBOM are generated in PLM . 8.4 Development Hardware Management Development hardware management activities start with the identification by the PMT of a reference model similar to the new engine program . Based on this model , OPM can start the long lead times analysis to highlight the required drawings release dates for the Key Components . A Development kit can be defined and loaded in SAP to secure common parts especially for derivative programs . Risk mitigation strategies to procure long lead time raw material for development needs as well as production are established . This analysis gets more refined and detailed following the identification and release of all new unique parts . As soon as the drawings become available , the OPM Planner initiates the procurement process . DTIS is the prime tool to be used to track the hardware status . OPM needs to follow up closely engine configuration changes and DTIS updates in order to ensure that the proper hardware is ordered ( refer to OPMP 4.10 Development Hardware Management for details ) .

"execution with Canadian Manufacturing sites , GO & S and Supply Chain NPI teams . 9.0 Sourcing and Manufacturing Strategy Prior to Passport 2 , the OPE / OPA drives activities to review , validate , influence and achieve agreement on the Program Sourcing Strategy with all stakeholders . The Program Sourcing Strategy form ( P & WC 11895 ) documents agreement on chosen production sources for Key Components . The OPE / OPA ensures that it is flown down to all NPI Sourcing Leads and Managers . Always ensure compliance with all Contractual obligations associated to the program and to ITC restrictions . Note : Please refer to OPMWI 3.11.1 Establish Component Strategy for details . 9.1 Advanced Program Sourcing Per Procurement Process ( PPP 06-15 ) , production sources are normally awarded following the receipt and analysis of three production quotes obtained from potential suppliers . This is applicable to all engine parts except for the Key Components that are part of the Program Sourcing Strategy form . In this latter case , considering that the sources are already identified , the OPM Planner must indicate them in the associated Job Tickets to ensure alignment . Please note that even if the source is identified in the Program Sourcing Strategy , Supply Management may elect to still query other sources for benchmarking purpose . If a sourcing change is requested or required on any Key Component ( usually part of the Program Sourcing Strategy form ) , a formal review is organized by the OPE / OPA and the final agreement is documented in a Component Strategy form ( P & WC 10367 ) . Whenever possible , experimental hardware orders shall be placed at the identified production sources . The objective is to prove the production sources as early as possible to minimize tooling and non- recurring costs , resolve producibility issues and minimize risks at entry into production . In the situation where the lead time is unacceptable to the program , a temporary source can be used if a formal transition strategy is defined and agreed upon by all stakeholders .

Otherwise the Work Transition ( Resourcing ) process will need to be used ( refer to MMP 300 ) . 9.2 Dual Sourcing Prior to Passport 2 , the Dual Sourcing Strategy recommendation has been documented in the Program Sourcing Strategy form P & WC 11895 . The execution of this strategy is dependent on the decision taken by Senior Management at Passport 1 to fully approve , partially approve or reject the proposal based on the business case results and the associated risks for the program . At the component level the OPE / OPA , in conjunction with Engineering and Supply Management , ensures progress on the execution of the Dual Sourcing Plan ( refer to MMP 348 ) as agreed at Passport 1 - Permission to Offer . In order to minimize substantiation costs , procurement of second source parts must occur on time to meet the Development Level 2 Plan . In case of a second source change or a new dual sourcing requirement , a formal review is organized by the OPE / OPA and the Component Strategy Sheet is used to document the agreement . Impact on the program business case needs to be assessed if any additional funds are required and a budget owner identified . At the engine level , the OPE / OPA , in conjunction with the Engine Centre Technical Support Manager , establishes the implementation plan of the second source and ensures progress to meet program requirements dates as per Program Operations Level 2 Plan . 10.0 Budget Management Prior to Passport 2 , the NPI Operations Budget ( P & WC 11847 ) is established by OPM to capture Operations ' funds required to industrialize a new program . Program CAR is raised by Strategic Financial Valuation ( SFV ) and approval must be obtained prior starting detailed design ( MMP 515 ) .

OPM has a key role to coordinate and monitor progress of activities with all organizations involved and address any issues that could jeopardize production engine deliveries . 14.1 IPTs and PMT As design work progresses toward Passport 3 , the OPE / OPA must ensure via the various design IPTs that all issues that can potentially affect production are getting adressed in a timely fashion . Progress of DP closure shall be closely monitored when impacting the production intent BS release for items such as : Engineering Source Approval ( ESA ) , Engineering Red Flag Notice ( RFN ) / Limit notice ( LN ) closure and post-cert Change Order ( CO ) releases . During the PMT , the OPE / OPA provides a general status on production engine parts and tooling . As mentionned previously in the Development phase section , any concerns on the engine design progress that can result in missing operational and customer commitments in terms of cost , schedule , producibility or quality , shall be highlighted . The OPE / OPA remains responsible to communicate the overall program status provided during the PMT , to Operations ' organizations ( Canadian Manufacturing sites , Supply Management , Engine Centres , etc . ) when deemed necessary . Note : Refer to the MMP 219 , Appendix H to obtain a more detailed list of key Operations deliverables expected at the IPT and PMT levels . 14.2 Production Build Specification Throughout the Development phase , Engineering releases multiple versions of the engine Build Specification ( BS ) .

"at the PMT any delay foreseen in the release of the production intent BS prior Passport 3 . All efforts shall be put forward by Engineering to release the BS on time for Operations . In the situation where the BS release date can not be met by Engineering , parts lead time analysis is performed by OPM . Multiple recovery actions , supported and agreed upon by Supply Management ( GO & S , Canadian Manufacturing and Engine Centre ) , can be taken depending on the configuration status , such as evaluating part expedite , creating production kit , raising risk orders , etc . ( Ref . Appendix A `` Guidelines for recovery actions due to Production BS delays '' ) . The proposed Operations recovery plan shall be communicated and agreed upon at the PMT . In all cases , the production intent BS release shall be closely monitored to ensure program and customer commitments are met . 14.3 Load new Build Specification in SAP The Change Incorporation Analyst ( CIA ) is responsible to load the production intent BS in SAP . OPM provides material master data for all unique parts while Development Process Planning supplies the AFS structure content . First production engines are expected to require more build time ( typically 2 months ) due to production manpower learning curve ( assemblers , inspectors , ATTS , etc . ) , audit engine requirements and Manufacturing Approval activities . This initial lead time needs to be agreed between OPM , Engine Centre Logistics and Master Scheduling . As soon as the BS is fully loaded in SAP and Passport 3 granted , the OPE / OPA contacts Master Scheduling to link the engine Master Production Schedule to the BS . From that point forward , production demand is generated at the parts level and any further configuration changes follow the CO process . When the first production intent BS is loaded in SAP , the packaging section may not be available as it is not fully defined yet . The OPE / OPA shall track the release of the packaging CO via the associated IPT . The objective is to ensure sufficient lead time to procure packaging material , proceed with substantiation and complete the Development PFMEA prior first production engine delivery .

In some instances , the PMT may want to accelerate these incorporations to meet a customer commitment , minimize financial impact for P & WC , etc . The OPE / OPA needs to validate with key stakeholders if accelerating the incorporation is achievable . In this case , a Limit Notice ( LN ) might be used to control inventory of the affected hardware .  Mandatory COs Mandatory COs are required for all production engines ( at P & WC or OEM ) prior aircraft entry into service ( EIS ) . There are two types of such COs : - `` Must All '' - Change must be incorporated on all engines at P & WC ( no engines are delivered at OEM yet ) . OEM . - `` Serial # and Mandatory Retrofit '' - Change must be incorporated on all engines at P & WC and As soon as a Mandatory Class 1 CO is identified by Engineering to introduce an urgent change on production engines , an Engineering Red Flag ( RFN ) should be raised against the affected parts to limit inventory and ensure control of configuration .  ESA Approval COs Status of ESA parts must be monitored as they can prevent engine shipment . Depending on the ESA type ( refer to CPW 135 ) , some or all of the following deliverables are required to change the status of an ESA part from `` Designated '' to `` Approved '' : 1 . ESA process submitted to manufacture the part is `` Approved '' ( if applicable ) ; 2 . Part has been received with a CofC confirming source and ESA process number ( if applicable ) ; 3 .

From that point on , any new CO affecting an ESA part is tracked carefully to ensure approval prior engine ship .  Shipment Restricted COs into production . After Engine Certification , any CO with pending substantiation are issued with Shipment Restriction . Tracking of actions required to lift the Shipment Restriction is critical to avoid any impact on the entry A list of all active Mandatory revision letters , COs , Engineering RFNs and LNs shall be presented at the PMT on a weekly basis to ensure target dates are respected and escalate any slips as per Program 's commitments ( refer to OPMP 5.10 for CO Tracking List template ) . This list can also help determine the need for risk hardware and document any upcoming OEUP and / or Return Engine activities ( see next section for more details ) . Note : Please refer to OPMP 5.10 Change Order Incorporation Management for more details . OPM is responsible to ensure that all the necessary hardware is available for first engine build , as per the Program Operations Level 1 & 2 Plan . Considering that the Integrated Material Flow ( IMF ) group only tracks part deliveries approximatively two ( 2 ) months prior engine build , the OPM Planner provides earlier visibility using the Supply Chain Action Required tool ( SCAR ) . This tool essentially shows if POs are placed on time and if parts deliveries are on track . In case of RFNs , LNs and mandatory COs , the impacted parts are integrated in the tool to ensure full visibility on production configuration . Any delivery issue that could affect entry into production is escalated and a recovery plan developed in conjunction with Supply Management , Manufacturing sites and Engineering . In the situation where a Mandatory CO release jeopardize hardware availability , OPM can decide to order risk hardware ( see Table 1 below for guidelines ) . Monitoring of CO release is critical to avoid any hardware delivery in In rare situations , when no recovery plan is possible , delaying the first engines deliveries or moving ahead with pre-production engines ( refer to section 16 for details ) must be discussed at the PMT and Note : Please refer to",OPMP_3_11_Industrialization_P2_to_EIS_WEB.pdf,OPMP_3_11_Industrialization_P2_to_EIS_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/03_Industrialization/3_11_Industrialization_P2_EIS/OPMP_3_11_Industrialization_P2_to_EIS_WEB.pdf

In the Program Operations Level 1 & 2 Plan , Manufacturing Approval IPTs start typically 4 months prior first engines build to allow sufficient time to perform all required activities . The OPE / OPA has a key role in coordinating all organizations involved in order to achieve completion of activities per the committed date .

If production hardware is unavailable and the customer requirement can not be postponed , then engines can only be delivered as Pre-Production engines . Note 1 : Please refer to OPMWI 3.11.6 Manage Pre-Production Engines for details Note 2 : EBU or Nacelle requirements are separate from the engine and therefore have no bearing on the engine 's production status . 15.1 Program Downgrade An engine program that does not have MA requires a program downgrade in order to ship engines . Moreover , if production standard hardware can not be procured in time for the engines and unsubstantiated hardware can be used , additional downgrade documentation is needed . Refer to Table 2 for details . Based on customer engine need dates and the estimated date for MA , the OPE / OPA determines the number of Pre-Production engines that will be required in order to minimize impact on documentation . If there is any uncertainty in the engine serial number range , a larger than needed range should be selected .

Unsubstantiated hardware is replaced with Production standard hardware as per the OEUP / Return engine processes OPMP 6.10 . Note : OPM best practice is to only send unique production hardware to the OEM after MA is obtained . If required and agreed upon by the PMT , the hardware upgrade on Pre-Production engines can be initiated prior obtaining MA by issuing Production parts with Form Ones that explain the Prototype status ( refer to QMSP 10-02 ) . When the engine configuration has met the minimum production standard , the engine can receive a new Production engine data plate , logbook and Form One . In order to be upgraded to Production Status , the engines only need to be upgraded to the Production Standard established at MA . Any product improvements that came after MA are not required in order to upgrade the engine . However they can be done at any time and may be required before the engines can enter service as per Section 14.4 . Any upgrades beyond what is required to bring the engines to Production and EIS standards should be reviewed with the PMT and coordinated by the OPE / OPA . Note : For cases where FAA & Emissions approvals are outstanding , the production data plate will still indicate that FAA and Emissions are `` pending '' and not `` approved '' . The OPE / OPA determines if the engine upgrades can proceed or wait until FAA & Emissions are `` approved '' . If upgrades proceed , then the data plates will need to be upgraded again prior EIS to show that FAA & Emissions are approved . 16.0 OEM Management OPM is responsible during Program Industrialization for OEM readiness activities , and in particular for :  Establishing consignment inventory of replacement material  Ensuring tooling availability required to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The timing of these activities is specified in the Program Operations Level 2 Plan .

Results are communicated to the OPM Budget Coordinator typically every second quarter of the year . ( Ref . OPMP 2.10 / OPMWI 2.10.1 ) 7.4 Escape Management The Escape Management process is initiated and led by Quality Managers or Project Engineers or respective delegates . It starts with a pre-escape meeting with the mandate to determine the risks and magnitude of the escape , to establish an appropriate plan of action for containment measures , to define root cause ( s ) , correctives action ( s ) and to determine proper documentation to promptly address the problem . ( Ref . QMSP 08-03-04 ) The need for a RFN is determined during the escape management process : • The Quality Red Flag Notice ( RFN ) is a mean to contain and maintain traceability of non-conforming product that has escaped the producer ’ s quality system . The decision for issuing a RFN is determined by the Escape Management Process . ( Ref . QMSP 08-03-04 ) • If the non-conformity leads to an Engineering escape , Engineering will lead the RFN meeting ( Ref . EOP 22 ) . As a result , Engineering RFN drives to new design release and CO production incorporation . OPE / OPA 's roles and responsibilities are defined in OPMP 5.10 CO Incorporation Management procedure .

As a result , OPM is informed about the project , affected hardware and schedule . Based on that , OPM resourcing lead communicates resourcing activity to affected Engine Program OPM team . OPE / OPA 's mandate is to ensure that Engine Program PMT 's and GWT IPT 's production incorporation targets are aligned and that there is no interference between two groups ’ production incorporation plans . In case that interference exists , it would be OPE / OPA 's responsibility to present findings to Engine Program PMT and to GWT IPT and request schedule adjustment . OPE / OPA liaison function between Engine Program PMT and GWT IPT shall seize upon resourcing project completion . In addition , resourcing activity and impact to engine program and FSC will be presented through Program Health Dashboard . 8.0 Program Logistics 8.1 Special Schedule Engine Query ( SSEQ )",OPMP_3_12_Legacy_Progm_Mgmt_WEB.pdf,OPMP_3_12_Legacy_Progm_Mgmt_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/03_Industrialization/OPMP_3_12_Legacy_Progm_Mgmt_WEB.pdf

OPM to provide YES / NO ( with proposed pushout dates ) answer and comments in the request based on the following input : • Manufacturing approval required and associated budget and capacity ; • Incorporated and pending release CO that could impact engine production ; • As a best practice , it is recommended to avoid last quarter of the year in order to minimize impact and risk on year-end deliveries . 8.2 Engine Schedule Request ( ESR ) Process Engine Schedule Request is a process managed by Master Scheduling and distributed by Accenture . OPE / OPA is responsible to review ESR and assess if schedule change affects Change Order ( CO ) production incorporation strategies and escalate to OPM / SI & OP Management if required . On occasions when ESR is rejected , OPE /OPA should evaluate possible strategies to support product sales . 8.3 New Build Specification Creation This document is electronically controlled .

The OPE / OPA is responsible for procedural compliance to QMSP 10-06 and OPMP 3.1 by initiating and leading Manufacturing Approval IPT until engine delivery . An SSEQ request will be required and will usually be the signal to launch the Restart process . 8.5 Conversion of Production Engines Production engine conversion is a process where engine could be converted from one build specification to another , or one engine model to another . This process is not applicable for uncertified engines or engines installed on an aircraft with Certificate of Airworthiness ( C of A ) or Export C of A . A Changer Order ( CO ) that contains instructions for the conversion of an engine is required when the engine has been released with an Authorized Release Certificate ( ARC ) and has been delivered to the OEM / Customer except for `` P & WC Leasing '' . Conversion CO is not required if the engine is still within P & WC Manufacturing premises ( not delivered to OEM ) which includes conversion prior ARC release , conversion from one build specification to another within same engine model and conversion from one engine model to another after being shipped to FPS or P & WC Leasing .

All manufacturing processes related to CTQ component key characteristics must achieve a level of stability and capability greater than or equal to a Cpk value of 1.33 . Where interactions may involve the use of technical data it is your responsibility to ensure export control requirements related to creating , receiving , handling , and handing off , per documents specified in section 3.0 , are respected . Process Certification is required when requested by the PMT . The decision should be based on program risk . Generally , new programs approach this process as standard work , however , engine derivatives may require some discussion and result in application to specific modules only . Prior to OPM agreement , the OPM Manager must be satisfied that the resources required to support the process are available as this represents additional work scope . Process Certification requirements are added to the component drawings by specifying CPW 153 in the notes and by identifying KPC ’ s . In the case of supplier defined components , the KPC ’ s are specified in a KPC list which is cross referenced on the note form drawing ( NFD ) . All KPC changes are considered class 2 Engineering Changes . This requires OPM follow up to ensure incorporation and to identify issues with tooling/gauging , cost or lead time .

Export Classification Operations Program Management Procedure OPMP : 3.6 3.0 DATE : 05 June 2013 REV : PAGE : 5 OF 8 Procedure Title : PROCESS CERTIFICATION FOR PROGRAMS Process Certification requirements are also added to the purchase order by specifying UTCQR 09.1 . This ensures the supplier has a quality system that will sustain process certification over time . The SQA core group has a rating system for the level of maturity of a supplier ’ s process certification system . Level 1 is unacceptable and Level 4 is world class . This may be a significant parameter for sourcing considerations and component strategies . Once the KPC ’ s are implemented , the capability data becomes available through the SAP supplier portal . The rules of data submission are controlled through procurement ’ s authorization to ship process along with sampling rules from CPW153 . Upholding the minimum Cpk requirement and/or the timeline to achieving this capability must be managed as part of the OPM risk management process 1.6 .

This decision is typically required before Passport 2 . This document does not contain data subject to the EAR , the ITAR , or ECL . Export Classification Operations Program Management Procedure OPMP : 3.6 3.0 DATE : 05 June 2013 REV : PAGE : 6 OF 8 Procedure Title : PROCESS CERTIFICATION FOR PROGRAMS 6.2 6.3 PROGRAM SCHEDULE Based on level one program plan from PMT , the OPE must synchronize procert activities to meet production readiness requirements per the passport process . CRITICAL TO QUALITY MATRIX The purpose of the CTQ matrix is to define the links between the CTQ criteria ( defined by project engineering ) and the engine components . Once a link is made , the CTQ component requires KPC ’ s . The OPM manager must action the PMT to create the CTQ criteria before the start of the detail design phase . The OPE should then coordinate with design and CM to add the official engine model TDBD list to the CTQ matrix . Initially , this may be based on design mini-layouts . The CTQ matrix is subsequently submitted to the modules in order to identify the CTQ components based on part functionality . Once the CTQ matrix is created , it must be stored in Documentum and displayed on the program website . 6.4 KPC ’ S ON DRAWINGS For each CTQ part number , the module centers must determine the KPC ’ s . For each KPC , the module centers must determine if it is a KPC1 , KPC2 or a KPCm .

"must be stored in Documentum and displayed on the program website . 6.4 KPC ’ S ON DRAWINGS For each CTQ part number , the module centers must determine the KPC ’ s . For each KPC , the module centers must determine if it is a KPC1 , KPC2 or a KPCm . The OPE will ensure , through the IPT , that the module centers are doing this task as per the level 1 plan . Once the KPC ’ s are defined , the drawings need to be revised and released . The OPM planner should track this activity using the procert scorecard mentioned in section 6.6 . 6.5 TOOLING BUDGET MANAGEMENT The OPE will determine the tooling requirements with the buyers , project engineers , and the producibility groups . They must evaluate if the current tooling and gauging is adequate to make the part with the addition of KPC ’ s . As the OPE must create a tooling budget for the whole program per OPM process 3.4 , the process certification requirements must be fed into this plan . 6.6 CREATING PROCERT SCORECARD The OPE creates a MS Excel Scorecard using the template in Documentum . See appendix A for example . The OPE adds the list of CTQ part numbers to the template . This document does not contain data subject to the EAR , the ITAR , or ECL . Export Classification Operations Program Management Procedure OPMP : 3.6 3.0 DATE : 05 June 2013 REV : PAGE : 7 OF 8 Procedure Title : PROCESS CERTIFICATION FOR PROGRAMS The OPE adds general information for each part number ( part description , ME , MA , QS , buyer , design engineer , project engineer , supplier , module center , engine module ) .This information will be provided by the producibility group and buyers . The OPM planner is then responsible to update the scorecard until the end of the Procert process . The module centers will determine and provide the number of KPC1 , KPC2 and KPCm . The producibility group will provide a status on the PRI and the MOS at the suppliers . The OPM planner will keep track of the # of KPC ’ s monitored and the # of KPC ’ s with a CPk of 1.33 using SAP . 6.7 RISK MANAGEMENT The OPE will perform a risk assessment . Based on the information gathered from the producibility group , the OPE must determine the parts that represent the highest risks for the process certification . These components will be ones which the producers have a high level of difficulty achieving a Cpk of 1.33 combined with a severe impact on CTQ criteria ( KPC1 ’ s and Major KPC2 ’ s ) . Based on the risk assessment , the OPE has the responsibility to create a level 2 plan with the producibility groups in order to set and revise priorities . The target is to have zero high risk ( red ) items by passport",OPMP_3_6_Process_Certif_for_Progms_WEB.pdf,OPMP_3_6_Process_Certif_for_Progms_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/03_Industrialization/OPMP_3_6_Process_Certif_for_Progms_WEB.pdf
"of 1.33 combined with a severe impact on CTQ criteria ( KPC1 ’ s and Major KPC2 ’ s ) . Based on the risk assessment , the OPE has the responsibility to create a level 2 plan with the producibility groups in order to set and revise priorities . The target is to have zero high risk ( red ) items by passport 4 . The OPE should organize periodic updates to the PMT . This will ensure that design jobs are not closed prematurely and provide input to the program manager for budget status . 6.8 PREPARATION FOR PASSPORT REVIEW The OPM Manager is responsible to report the procert status at Passport reviews . Using the level 2 plan , the Scorecard and the CTQ matrix , the OPE will summarise the issues on problematic components . A risk mitigation plan should also be presented for all problematic components . The presentation should also include a summary of the scorecard . For example : % of drawings released , % of suppliers procert ready , % of MOS changed and % of KPC ’ s with CPk over 1.00 and 1.33 6.9 PREPARATION FOR PROCESS CERTIFICATION A part number will be certified when all its KPC ’ s comply to a CPk of 1.33 .

"Passport Gate 0 thru 1 Refer to Roles and Responsibilities as defined in MMP501 . Engineering defines the engine architecture to meet program cost objectives ( i.e . business case ) . OPM works along side with Engineering , Procurement and Strategic Sourcing to drive the sourcing strategy to meet program cost and support Product Cost in defining a Cost Basis Note ( “ CBN ” ) . Passport Gate 1 thru 2 Refer to Roles and Responsibilities as defined in MMP501 . Shortly after Engineering releases preliminary drawings , OPM requests that Strategic Sourcing convene a supplier conference . Strategic Sourcing organizes the supplier conference while Procurement prepares and issues preliminary Request For Quote ( “ RFQ ” ) packages . The conference is an opportunity for Operations and Engineering to meet the suppliers and ask questions as they present their proposals . The proposals submitted by suppliers and/or in-house producers are reviewed by all departments ; the specific task of OPM is to actively participate in IPT and review quotes to identify cost savings opportunities . These quotes are made available in a secured location , such as the Vroom , by the Commodity Management NPI team.OPM will provide IPT ’ s feedback to Procurement , which ultimately selects the source . The manufacturing business units are ultimately responsible for the supplier selection , will track the relevant quote data ( ex : part number , supplier selected , batch size , learned-out cost ) and will make the quote database available to the Product Cost group . A single database can be used for each business unit , i.e . it does not need to be split by program . The Product Cost team will extract the relevant information directly from each BU database to build the cost file for each program . Once the suppliers have been selected , the Product Cost Group identifies the components making up 80 % of the cost . OPM supports in driving the IPT cost targets . Product cost group will issue cost status . This cost status is refreshed for each milestone event ( ex . Passport ) and PCOR . Passport Gate 2 thru 3 Refer to Roles and Responsibilities as defined in MMP501 . Procurement issues revised RFQ packages based on detailed drawings released by Engineering . The suppliers review the latest definition and re-submit final quote proposals . The manufacturing business units are ultimately responsible for the supplier selection , will track the relevant quote data ( ex : part number , supplier selected , batch size , learned-out cost ) and will make the quote database available to the Product Cost group . A single database can be used for each business unit , i.e . it does not need to be split by program . The Product Cost team will extract the relevant information directly from each BU database to build the cost file for each program .

"A single database can be used for each business unit , i.e . it does not need to be split by program . The Product Cost team will extract the relevant information directly from each BU database to build the cost file for each program . If a supplier ’ s proposal are less than or equal to the CBN cost target , OPM will work with Procurement who negotiates with suppliers to obtain further cost reductions where possible . If the final quote proposal is above the CBN target cost , the supplier is requested to validate and/or provide an explanation of the discrepancy using the P & WC Delta Cost Form template . The Cost IPT initiates cost reduction initiatives if the cost deviates from its original target . For example , it may organize a Value Engineering Session ( “ VES ” ) , to which Engineering and the Supply Management Technical Team participate , to identify areas where the part may be cost-optimized . The buyers work with the producers as well to identify areas of opportunities to bring the cost of the part within program objectives . The supplier may elect to review and resubmit its quote . OPM oversees the execution of the specific product component strategies . In cases where there is a design change , Product cost tracks all design jobs , the cost impact of each design job , and reports the cost exposure associated with each design job . The cost delta estimate produced by Engineering helps Procurement evaluate the suppliers ’ new quotes , with the support of OPM . If no design change originates from Engineering prior to the engine certification ( Passport Gate 3 ) , the Bill of Material ( “ BOM ” ) is loaded in SAP , and Procurement issues production Purchase Orders ( “ ” ) . The Level 2 program plan ( OPMP 1.2 ) drives SAP BOM release , and it is driven by first production engine build / delivery date . Passport Gate 3 thru 4 Refer to Roles and Responsibilities as defined in MMP501 . The manufacturing business units are ultimately responsible for the supplier selection , will track the relevant quote data ( ex : part number , supplier selected , batch size , learned-out cost ) and will make the quote database available to the Product Cost group . A single database can be used for each business unit , i.e . it does not need to be split by program . The Product Cost team will extract the relevant information directly from each BU database to build the cost file for each program . A critical part of the validation process is Paretoing of the factory standard cost ( “ FSC ” ) . The Pareto ’ s principle , also known as the “ 80-20 ” rule , helps manage the items that make a significant difference in results . Utilizing such principle , Product Cost Group issues a list of the top ( typically in the",OPMWI_2_2_1_FSC_Management_WEB.docx,OPMWI_2_2_1_FSC_Management_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/03_Industrialization/OPMWI_2_2_1_FSC_Management_WEB.docx
"A critical part of the validation process is Paretoing of the factory standard cost ( “ FSC ” ) . The Pareto ’ s principle , also known as the “ 80-20 ” rule , helps manage the items that make a significant difference in results . Utilizing such principle , Product Cost Group issues a list of the top ( typically in the order of 40 ) offending parts that represent about 80 % of the cost delta . If an FSC discrepancy occurs during the program certification , the Cost IPT investigates the cost delta with the relevant organizations ( i.e . Engineering , Procurement , Manufacturing , Producers , etc . ) to understand the cost variations . Any variation shall be be validated with the relevant organizations or producer . If the discrepancy is validated and accepted the Product Cost monthly status report shall be corrected . If the variation results in the cost objective not being met , the Cost IPT will initiate cost reduction activities with the relevant organizations to get the cost of the part to meet program cost objectives . On the other hand , if the variation is not valid , OPM will challenge relevant organizations to correct the cost . Post-Certification ( i.e . beyond Passport Gate 4 ) Refer to Roles and Responsibilities as defined in MMP501 . The FSC of the engine is tracked on a monthly basis and reported by the Product cost group The monthly report is reviewed by the Engineering Program to understand any variations that may exist . Variations in the FSC that are not planned ( particularly those that results in an increase to the FSC ) are challenged . Once all variations are understood , the FSC is reported to senior management at the monthly ORM . In instances where there is a design change , OPM will work with the IPT and understand the impact to the cost of the affected components . If the design change results in the cost of the part increasing , OPM , along with the IPT , will work to bring the cost down to meet program cost objectives . In cases where the design change results in a cost reduction , OPM , along with the IPT , will work with the Product cost group to ensure the price reduction is reported when the part is introduced into production . In other instances , the supplier who produces the part may change ( resourcing ) . If the resourcing activity is for cost reduction , OPM works with product cost group to track the reduction and ensures that the price reduction is reported when the new source begins delivering the parts . In the event parts are resourced for other reasons ( such as capacity ) there may be a cost increase . In such instances , OPM works closely with the procurement organization to ensure the cost increase is justified and reasonable , as well as working to minimize the increase .

Note : It is preferable to hold a meeting and discuss as a group , the proposed change of source . However the OPE / OPA can decide to hold one-on-one reviews separately . Approval of form P & WC 10367 is still mandatory . Hold the Component Strategy meeting . Review and discuss the proposed sourcing change of the component under review . Typical questions to be asked : 1 . Temporary Sourcing Change a ) What are the reasons of the change ? ( Leadtime , Supply Management strategy , etc . ) b ) Why ca n't we run orders on temporary and permanent sources in parallel ? c ) What are the impacts on tooling cost ? Which budgets are affected ? d ) What is the implementation plan of the temporary vs permanent sources ( define in terms of quantity or specific date ) ? Are we going to have enough time to prove the permanent source in order to resolve producibility issues prior production ?

Without manufacturing approval , engines can not be shipped as production standard . However we may ship as Pre-Production engines ( also known as X-engines or Prototype engines ) by downgrading the engines . This Work Instruction provides the step by step activities to allow the shipment of Pre-Production engines , along with the requirements to bring them to Production Standard . As per QMSP 10-12 a Pre-Production Engine is defined as : `` An engine that has been assembled , tested and received an Authorized Release Certificate as “ prototype ” status on a TCCA Form One by a P & WC Engine Centre Production environment and intended to be approved for in-service operation .

PMT This WI begins at the point that the PMT has confirmed that Pre-Production engines will need to be delivered . Before a Pre-Production engine can start build , the Conformity Inspection ( CI ) should be complete ( Ref . MMP 225 ) . There may be rare situations where a Pre-Production engine is required before the CI is complete . In this case a waiver may be granted by the Program Manager , Quality Systems Manager and the DAA ( Design Approval Appointee ) or CVE ( Compliance Verification Engineering ) . REF . MMP 225 Section 3 `` Exceptions '' part e ) and Section 10 . A sample waiver memo is provided ( see Sample CI Waiver ) . Please note that this option should only be pursued if absolutely necessary due to the high risk of building an engine without the CI having been done to confirm that the Bill of Material , SAP and AFS are aligned .

If this is the case and production hardware will not be available in time , a suitable alternative can be used as recommended by Engineering . This could be development hardware deemed suitable by Engineering , or it could be the yet-to-be released Production parts issued from development stores .

If Production hardware is not available , reference Steps # 13 - 16 ( below ) Provisioning of production hardware for upgrade & planning of resources OEUPs ( Original Equipment Upgrade Plan ) need to be raised to bring the Pre-Production engines up to Production Standard . Even if engines will be returned an OEUP is required for accounting purposes . As an I.O . is generated with the OEUP , and engine that is returning solely for upgrades does not require a return engine I.O .. If a return engine I.O . is raised , that is acceptable , but Operations Finance needs to be informed . 3 OPE / OPA Project Engineering Determine if engines can be upgraded at the OEM , or if they need to be returned to Production for upgrade . 4 OPE / OPA OPM Budget Coordinator Inform the OPM Budget Coordinator of the upcoming need for Original Equipment Upgrade Plans ( OEUPs ) both for the program upgrade and , if required , the replacement of any unsubstantiated hardware . The Budget Coordinator will need to know the approximate funding required if a non-production Mobile Repair Team is required ( i.e . Purchase Order funding ) to do the upgrade ( s ) . Ideally this request should be submitted to the OPM Budget Coordinator the prior December . Inform Financial Planning ( Dept . 1261 ) of the upcoming OEUP ( s ) and approximate cost for hardware and labour . For assistance in determining the resources required for the MRT you may consult several resources : Service Engineering , Process Planning , Engine Centre or the Service Centre that may be providing the MRT . Use Cost Estimate from OEUP Form P & WC 11412 5 OPE / OPA For both engines that will be returned and for engines that will be upgraded at the OEM , generate an upgrade matrix so that material and resources ( MRT ) are properly driven and schedule of upgrades is made available . This will also show which engines have been upgraded . Sample Upgrade Matrix Attached 6a OPE / OPA One OEUP will be required for the Program Upgrade , referencing the program upgrade CO ( REF . Step # 11b below ) . The OEUP will require replacement dataplates and rivets . Labour for the plate printing and installation may also need to be provisioned .

Although new engines can be built to production configuration at any time , they are still Pre-Production until Manufacturing Approval is complete and the Upgrade CO issued with the Pre-Production engine range defined . Usually the first engine with Production standard hardware is also the MA engine , but MA can be done at a later engine if dictated by resources or the documentation ( CO , AQP and TATP ) . For instance , if the documentation has pegged a later engine to be the first production ( MA ) engine , it may not be worth the resources to change the documentation as compared to the resources required to upgrade additional engines . When all the conditions for MA are met , it may be convenient to do MA on a fully production standard engine that is part of the Pre-Production engine range . Yet it might be undesirable to change the documentation to change the Pre-Production engine range to exclude this engine . If this is the case , please inform Quality Systems so that they may inform Transport Canada that the Manufacturing Approval will be done on an engine that is Pre-Production .

Along with Cyient , using P & WC 11297 , track the receipt and delivery of hardware to P & WC stores . Any shortages shall be highlighted and escalated ( typically the same shortages as for the first production engines ) . Keep OPM Planner informed of any configuration changes to parts originally planned . PRE-PRODUCTION ENGINES Contact FSR to agree on the timing of the common parts to be shipped , in line with shipping of the first pre-production engine . Ensure hardware will be segregated , properly stored and access controlled . Perform a shortage analysis on the parts to identify which ones can be shipped to the OEM , without compromising parts clearance for production engines builds . OPM best practice is to only send production hardware that is unique to the program to OEM after Manufacturing Approval ( MA ) is obtained . If it is required to ship unique parts prior MA , an agreement by the PMT is necessary such that the consignment inventory can be shipped prior obtaining MA . In this situation a manual `` Prototype '' Form One with special notations must be generated for the specific part S/N inspected by an Authorized Inspector ( AI ) ( as per QMSP 10-02 Section 5.12.2 ) . Request Cyient to replace NOP with Sales Order on parts ready to ship ; record all S.O . and delivery number for each P/N in P & WC 11297 . Prerequisite to shipping : Selling price available in SAP ( provided by spares organization ) . Forward information to OEM FSR . Follow-up with OEM FSR to confirm receipt of deliveries . PRODUCTION ENGINES When TCCA Manufacturing Approval have been granted , perform a shortage analysis to identify which unique parts can be shipped to the OEM , without compromising parts clearance for the committed production engines builds . Note : If it is required to ship unique parts prior MA , an agreement by the PMT is necessary such that the consignment inventory can be shipped prior obtaining MA , in this situation a manual `` Prototype '' Form One with special notations must be generated for the specific part S/N inspected by an Authorized Inspector ( AI ) ( as per QMSP 10-02 Section 5.12.2 ) .

Also , some P/Ns refer in drawings to active models ( e.g . CRP parts re-identified for Industrial Engines ) . Note : Ensure the unique castings are well identified , as some enginering layouts may have expired . Check layout status in SAP . Use SAP QM15 transaction , do not click `` Completed '' , expand the date interval , look at layout expiration date . Organize a kickoff meeting with stakeholders to understand engine situation and raise actions accordingly : ( list is not exhaustive ) 1 . Confirm the scope of the Conformity Inspection ( full , delta ) per MMP225 . Note : Engine models last produced prior to eCATES introduction ( 2006-2009 ) will require AFS transformations ( e.g . AMAX to eCATES ) . Post AFS transfer 3P and bulk kitting exercise will also be required . 2 . Understand engine testing requirements . Some BSs will require slave H/W to be used . Parent engine models may be required to 'loan ' production H/W to support engine testing . Schedule meetings with Process Planning to establish requirements and determine if slave kits are available . 3 . Engine Centre : tooling available , test cell ? 4 . Evaluate Operations Risks ( OPMWI 3.10.3 ) Four to six months prior engine build , start Manufacturing Approval ( MA ) / Manufacturing Readiness ( MR ) activities per OPMP 3.1 . Schedule review on a bi-weekly or weekly basis with Supply management to ensure material availability at time of engine build .

"SSEQ Process Testing requirements Slave Hardware requirements How many engines have been produced in the past 5 , 10 , 15 , 20+ years ? What are the key factors that should go into assessing if the engine should be considered a `` Re-Start '' ? Were there any major transformative events ( e.g. , AMAX to eCATES , PLM , Supplier strategy , etc . ) since the last engine was produced that could affect engine delivery ? Major vs. Minor Re-Start ? What timeline or events should be considered for a suggested categorization ? What level of due diligence should be required for each categorization ? Example : Minor - 2 to 5 years with no major transformative events Major - 6+ years Escape occurred where a non-maintained BS was loaded into a SSEQ .

While this process is driven by Engineering , OPM is responsible to ensure the engine meets production standard prior to upgrade back to Production . - The installation of non-production components on production standard engines for testing at the customer ( ie Customer Engines on a Proto or Demo A/C ) . The removal of these parts will return the engines to production standard . This process is driven completely by Engineering . - Due to a critical part shortage in production , the customer may request production engines that include non-production standard parts to allow them to progress their flightline . These parts would need to be replaced via an OEUP . This process is driven completely by OPM .

This can be requested from Operations Finance or might be available direct from the source of the shortage ( ie . Escape , Procurement ) . A suitable alternative for the part that is short to be recommended by Engineering . Note : This part will need to be replaced with Production pedigree parts in order for the engine ( s ) to eventually be upgraded to Production . Provisioning of production hardware for upgrade & planning of resources OEUPs ( Original Equipment Upgrade Plan ) need to be raised to bring the downgraded engine ( s ) back to Production Standard . Even if engines will be returned an OEUP is required for accounting purposes . As an I.O . is generated with the OEUP , and engine that is returning solely for upgrades does not require a return engine I.O .. If a return engine I.O . is raised , that is acceptable , but Operations Finance needs to be informed . Determine if engine ( s ) can be upgraded at the OEM , or if they need to be returned to Production to install production hardware . Inform the OPM Budget Coordinator of the upcoming need for an Original Equipment Upgrade Plans ( OEUP ) to replace the unsubstantiated hardware and upgrade the engine ( s ) .

For assistance in determining the resources required for the MRT you may consult several resources : Service Engineering , Process Planning , Engine Centre or the Service Centre that may be providing the MRT . One OEUP will be required for the installation of the production part and the upgrade of the engine ( s ) . OEUP will reference the program upgrade CO ( REF . Step # 9c below ) . The OEUP will also require replacement engine dataplates and rivets . Labour for the plate printing and installation may also need to be provisioned . Production standard hardware needs to be ordered . If part ( s ) are released to Production they can be ordered on NOP demands . If there is a design change and new parts are not yet released to Production , orders to be on risk order and later transferred to Production when CO is issued . Although engine data plates are bulk , if there will be a large number of upgrades , NOPs should also be placed for the data plates . The Downgrade Due to the Installation of Unsubstantiated Hardware As per Step # 2 - if unsubstantiated hardware is required : Engineering to define what can be used . This could be development hardware deemed suitable by Engineering , or it could be the yet-to-be released Production parts issued from development stores . NOTE : These parts will need to be replaced with production pedigree parts in order for the engine to be upgraded to production . Even production parts delivered via risk order / experimental stores will need to be removed as they will have lost their production stamp . Based on the customer need dates and the expected date that production parts are available , determine the number of engines that will be built with alternate hardware and will need to be downgraded . Ideally the number of downgraded engines should be minimized as much as possible . However setting or changing the number of downgraded engines requires a Change Order ( CO ) , revised Airworthiness Quality Plan ( AQP ) and a Temporary Assembly & Test Procedure ( TATP ) supplement . Therefore to eliminate the potential for numerous push-outs and re-issuing of these documents , it is recommended that if there is ANY uncertainty in when Production hardware will be available and how many engines will be downgraded , that a large number of engines be used . When it is certain on which engine Production hardware will be available , the documentation need only be revised once to pull in . Raise a PLM Change Request ( CR ) to request the downgrade of the selected engine range .

NOTE : A Ship-Short must not be confused with a Downgrade due to the installation of unsubstantiated hardware as the process differs . See OPMWI 5.10.1 for a Ship-Short . Upon request from OPM , raise a Design Intent Document ( DID ) . Provide the CO # for the Program downgrade to OPM and progress to an in-work state . Reserve a CO # for the future program upgrade CO and provide to OPM . When production hardware is available , the corresponding upgrade CO can be progressed to a complete state . Draft a Temporary Assembly & Test Procedure ( TATP ) Request to request : - The installation of unsubstantiated hardware .

It is then submitted to Operations Finance for entry into SAP . By November , OPM will go through iterations upon feedback from Executives via Finance . Final figures are then communicated to all OPE / OPA 's . 9.0 Phase 3 - Raise CAR for Inventoried Equipment By mid-November , the OPE / OPA 's validate final Capital figures for legacy equipment as per approved budget . By early December , the Budget Coordinator raises the annual CAR & Business Case with the support of the OPE / OPA 's for legacy equipment as per latest OPM Budget Estimate . Upon CAR approval , ask Operations Finance to open the Internal Orders ( I.O 's ) according to programs ' needs and to add them to the Consolidated Report .

Introduction The purpose of this cookbook is to explain how to manage Program Customer Operations Review ( PCOR ) owned by the OPM Sr . Manager . It provides program status , directions , and strategies . The attendance is composed of Marketing , CQM , STOA , SI & OP , PMT and all Operations Business Units top offenders . The goal of this review is to highlight the top ten medium and long term issues in order to be able to assess the ability to meet customer demand over a horizon of two years and , also , all the Program strategies . When a new program is starting , the PCOR is an opportunity to address the Operations Business Directors to present the new program with a dedicated NPI PCOR . PCOR presentation preparation is done by the Operations Program Engineer ( OPE ) or Operations Program Analyst ( OPA ) with the support of OPM Management when necessary . The PCOR checklist is found on the OPM website . Logistics Section The PCOR meetings invitation ( including room reservation ) is sent by the OPM Sr. Manager ’ s Administrative Assistant . Usually the meetings are scheduled on Mondays for the year ahead and occur approximately every 3 months per program . OPM Sr . Manager sends the invitation to a core distribution list that remains the same for all PCORs , it includes VP , BU Managers , Engineering and Quality . For OPM , the process starts at least three weeks ahead of PCOR presentation with a discussion between OPM Manager , OPE / OPA and Planner to identify Top Program Issues ( mid to long term ) . Usually the previous PCOR slides are used to initiate the meeting , and from that discussion , an agenda is prepared which also identifies the presenters and / or slide owners . The OPE / OPA is responsible to add to the main invitation , the slide presenters / owners that will present the Top Program Issues . This is done by forwarding the invitation for the PCOR in Outlook . A reconfirmation via phone or email may be needed because OPE / OPA does not own the invitation and does not see the acceptance status .

"to add to the main invitation , the slide presenters / owners that will present the Top Program Issues . This is done by forwarding the invitation for the PCOR in Outlook . A reconfirmation via phone or email may be needed because OPE / OPA does not own the invitation and does not see the acceptance status . Tip : Names of the owner of the slides are indicated in yellow square at the top right to facilitate update . Ensure that the appropriate Export Control is indicated on footer of the “ slide master ” . This is a suggested email template to send with the package containing the slides to be revised or created , the due date for receiving final slides and a dry run date ( if applicable ) : PCOR for ABC Program will be presented on Monday , November 9th 2016 . Slide completion date : No later than Friday , October 30th We are scheduling one dry run : Tuesday , November 3rd ( If your section is part of the dry run your team will receive an invitation ) The OPM team will be following up with you in order to be ready for the dry run and final slide submission . Please send all slides to my attention . Many thanks ! Tip : Table with topic and owner could facilitate slide updates . It has the advantage of including the agenda in the body of the email , to provide quick view of what is expected : Example of email sent October 23rd requesting slides 8 days before the PCOR ( Nov 2nd ) Tip : It is very important to send a reminder to the people that have to provide a slide . Usually this email has to be sent a few days before the due date . Example of email sent the 28th of October , due date is Nov 2nd ( reminder ) PCOR Content Preparation For programs past Passport 3 ( Permission to Order Production Hardware ) or Passport 4 ( Permission to Deliver Serial Production ) or past Passport 5 ( In Service Program Review and Permission to Close Passport Process ) , the content is described below . Rolling Action Items List The rolling action items list ( RAIL ) is kept in SharePoint in the same location as the PCOR . The OPE/OPA is responsible to maintain the list and ensure between PCOR that the actions are reviewed /closed . This RAIL is used also in the Program Clinic and the actions get closed between PCOR . So at the beginning of the PCOR the action list of the previous PCOR is presented . Most of the actions are closed , except the complex ones as shown in example below . Executive Summary The executive summary describes briefly what happened since last PCOR with the key updates and the next challenges . Demand Outlook The demand outlook curves show per quarter the demand curve comparison over the last 6 months and the required weekly",OPMWI_1_10_1_PCOR_WEB.docx,OPMWI_1_10_1_PCOR_WEB.txt,https://collaboration.pwc.ca/team/D1248OPM/Documents/00IntranetDocsAllUsers/01_Progm_Mgmt_Comm/OPMWI_1_10_1_PCOR_WEB.docx

Executive Summary The executive summary describes briefly what happened since last PCOR with the key updates and the next challenges . Demand Outlook The demand outlook curves show per quarter the demand curve comparison over the last 6 months and the required weekly production rates for the next three years . This slide is provided by SI & OP . OTD Performance The OTD Performance shows OTD to P.O. , OTC and MRP . This slide is provided by SI & OP Top Program Issues The top program issues are determined by the Operations Risk Cube or XRM Active Risks bar chart “ 8-week outlook ” . The issues that prevent OTD of engines such as : high retest ratio , low On-time to Clear ( OTC ) , high QN activity , Quality Escapes , OEM interventions , etc . are the “ Top Program Issues ” . Tip : The OPE / OPA are not responsible to make the slides for the Top Program issues , but to provide the standard template . A typical slide for Top Program issue must contain : Issue , Root Cause , Corrective Action , Picture or diagram and Milestone section . This is the standard template that is sent when a new issue is identified : Below are two examples of a good quality content and presentation . Tip : The OPE/OPA is not responsible to correct or adjust the slides , but to resend to owner with comments and suggestion to ensure the content will meet the PCOR intent . FSC / Actions FSC status water fall generated and maintained by the Cost Group is to be presented with justification for cost increases or cost saving . As per MMP501 , the OPE/OPA attending the cost IPT will be aware of the FSC variation on the programs and the actions taken to reduce the increases and the initiative to bring further cost reductions . This section is presented by the OPE / OPA if needed ( FSC does not meet Cost Basis Note ) . Engine Centre Status / Retest The ATTS will provide the standard slide for retest ration along with the root cause and corrective actions for retest ratios above 1.10 . Return Engines Status / Turn-Around Time The Return engines status is provided by the Engine Centre Line Managers . The slide should include the following legend : OEUP Status If there are active or planned Original Equipment Upgrade Plan ( OEUP ) , the OPE / OPA should present the scope , number of engines , completion status and expected closure date . This is of interest to Supply Management to make them aware of added demands on some parts .

By asking the invitation ’ s chairperson to send the package , we ensure that all the added invitees receive the package . The package needs to be sent at the latest on the previous business day before 14h00 . Post PCOR Actions This is an example of RAIL populated just after a PCOR , it contains : PCOR date , item number , program , part , description of issue , responsible , target original and revised ( if needed ) as well as status . During the PCOR the actions are noted , and after the presentation the OPE / OPA sends an email to the PCOR distribution list to inform the stakeholders of the status . That list is stored in SharePoint , and will be presented at the beginning of the next PCOR ( see previous section ) . NPI PCOR Content Preparation For New Product Introduction ( NPI ) Programs before Passport 1 ( Permission to study ) to Passport 2 ( Permission to continue detailed design ) slide can be presented in the Legacy PCOR to provide a quick status or to engage the managers . These are examples of the “ one slider ” that could be prepared and presented by OPM . For NPI PCOR , when the program is after Passport 2 ( Permission to continue detailed design ) , there is sufficient activity to present a stand-alone NPI PCOR . The content is defined in the checklist and follows the Operations Program Management Procedures ( OPMP ) . The PCOR checklist is found on the OPM website .

Persons Responsible Scope The `` Sustainment '' Phase ( Figure 1 ) intent is : • • • • To execute the closure of production capability , and end-of-delivery , for top-level systems and/or select sub-systems and parts for a given product line . To establish end-of-sustainment activity transition planning while continuing to provide operational safety initiatives , customer support and aftermarket strategies . To begin planning during the Pursuit-to-Startup Phase . Sustainment activity begins during the Production Phase . To anticipate and respond to changing logistics support , technical requirements and environments to allow continued operation and support within cost , schedule , and risk constraints . adapting or modifying the support system to accommodate anticipated or unanticipated change . disbanding of Program Management Team ( PMT ) . To document lessons learned and incorporate into the program closeout registry for review by future projects . • A Discontinuation of Support Gate which authorizes closure of the business case and • • A dual nature in that it provides support to the product as designed and fielded as well as Gates and Milestone Reviews Determination Figure 1 : Sustainment Phase Framework • No RTX-required Gates within the Sustainment Phase ◦ Production Closure/Field Support gate precedes Sustainment Phase . ◦ Discontinuation of Support Gate ceases all program efforts and ends Sustainment Phase . • Milestone Review prior to support the Sustainment Phase ◦ Sustainment Readiness Review • Regular Cadence Reviews occur during the Production and Sustainment Phases ◦ Applicable broadly to support/sustainment related efforts ◦ ◦ Occur at a regular interval until Discontinuation of Support Gate is complete .

Per the defined plan maturity level of “ preliminary ” ( initial creation ) , “ draft ” ( update ) , and “ baseline ” ( for continued execution ) . The plan maturity level is based on program , product , or service as applicable for each phase . “ Preliminary ” - Contains a conceptual description of the activities to be performed , along with any associated assumptions . The plan contains enough detail to support the level of bidding and/or estimates required at the particular point in a program ’ s life cycle . “ Draft ” - Adds further details to the conceptual information and assumptions from the Preliminary Plan . The level of detail provided needs to be robust enough to support the level of bidding and commitment being made . “ Baseline ” - Contains a detailed , executable plan that will meet the intended program requirements and that is ready for implementation . Gates are defined as follows ( see Related Information for more information ) : a . Strategy ( Gate A ) b. Submit/Commit ( Gate B ) c. Startup ( Gate C ) d. Production Readiness ( Gate D ) e. Production Closure/Field Support ( Gate E ) f. Discontinuation of Support ( Gate F ) Persons Responsible Program Manager Applicability Applies to efforts involve RLPM planning .

Persons Responsible Scope Provide examples of tailoring as described in GCP-59 . Applicability This guideline applies to all : 1 . Organizations within RTX , including its major Business segments ( each , a “ Business ” ) , 2 . Majority-owned or controlled joint ventures and other majority-owned or controlled 3 . Directors , officers , employees , contractors , and any other persons who work for these divisions , and direct and indirect subsidiaries ; entities and operations ; and organizations . This guideline applies throughout the RTX Lifecycle Program Management ( RLPM ) . See Exhibit A of GCP-59 . Persons Affected This guideline is information for stakeholders trying to tailor the RLPM . Guideline Tailoring position is that the program complies with contractual , regulatory , and GCP-59 requirements . `` And GCP-59 '' means all the “ must ” statements that apply to the Program can not be tailored out and are executed in the intended phase . `` Apply '' means if the product or service intends to execute one or multiple phases in the products intended lifecycle then the `` must '' statements intended for those phases can not be tailored out and are done in the intended phase . Per GCP-59 , a tailoring plan is developed prior to proposal kickoff as part of the Program Plan that shows when each applicable `` must '' statement will be accomplished across the program lifecycle . Any gaps require an approved waiver per GCP-59 . Per the Business approval process , if the Business wants to tailor out a `` must '' that is applicable to the Program then the Program requests a waiver prior to the proposal kickoff . RTX - Internal Use Only 3 GUI-TGE-RLPM-002 — RLPM Tailoring Examples RTX - Internal Use Only Tailoring examples may include : 1 . Assume that a program determines , within the tailoring rules of the Business , that a Strategy Gate is not required . Even if that gate is not held , there are key artifacts that comprise the entrance criteria for that gate ( for example , Technical Baseline and Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) /Manufacturing Readiness Level ( MRL ) ) still need to be generated to support downstream activities . In practice , most , if not all Gate or Milestone Review entrance criteria are necessary for future work . 2 . Assume a Business is under contract to execute scope through Preliminary Design",GUI-TGE-RLPM-002 RLPM Tailoring Examples.pdf,GUI-TGE-RLPM-002 RLPM Tailoring Examples.txt,https://epolicy.corp.ray.com/epolicy/Documents/GUI-TGE-RLPM-002%20RLPM%20Tailoring%20Examples.pdf
"( for example , Technical Baseline and Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) /Manufacturing Readiness Level ( MRL ) ) still need to be generated to support downstream activities . In practice , most , if not all Gate or Milestone Review entrance criteria are necessary for future work . 2 . Assume a Business is under contract to execute scope through Preliminary Design Review ( PDR ) on new development work . Also assume that the customer has not identified an initial Design Failure Modes and Effects Analysis ( DFMEA ) delivery as part of PDR . It would be inappropriate to tailor the initial DFMEA out of contract 1 based on the possibility that findings from the initial DFMEA could impact the PDR-level design . Delaying DFMEA work until Critical Design Review ( CDR ) preparation would introduce unnecessary risk to overall program execution . The same rationale would apply if contract 1 was an Engineering and Manufacturing Development ( EMD ) contract and contract 2 was Low Rate Initial Production ( LRIP ) or Full Rate Production ( FRP ) . 3 . If work performed uses an incremental customer funding model ( for example , contract funding through preliminary design ( contract 1 ) followed by a down-select for funding through critical design ( contract 2 ) ) , activities that are normally initiated during contract 1 , but not complete/delivered until contract 2 should not be tailored out of contract 1 . In cases where this work is tailored out contract 1 , a plan is developed and approved by the Gate approval authority to assure that this work is completed off-contract prior to the need date on contract 2 . 4 . Demonstration ( Demo ) contract : The intent of the demo is to develop a proof of concept demonstration unit and then show its performance capabilities . If successful Raytheon would have the opportunity to compete for an EMD contract and then have the opportunity to compete for a LRIP/FRP contract ( s ) . The demo contract does not reference DFMEA as a requirement . In this case DFMEA requirement can be tailored out of the demo contract because Raytheon will have the opportunity to execute that scope in its intended phase . The DFMEA scope is be included in the future EMD proposal ( prior to PDR ) even if it is not explicitly referenced in the contract . • Reasoning : Just because a contract is silent on : • MRL • DFMEA • • Design to Unit Production Cost ( DTUPC ) FMEA • Does not mean RTX does not want to include that scope in the appropriate phase ( typically in an EMD contract prior to PDR ) . If RTX does not include it then the offering will likely not include manufacturability , reliability , and unit cost in its design as a constraint .

The following section is a summary of the IPMP product life cycle structure . IPMP uses a phased structure to support gated processes within P & WC that is scaled and tailored depending on the Program archetype . The primary gated process governing IPMP is the RLPM process ( MMP 220 ) which evolves over four phases . This section is supported by Appendix G – IPMP RLPM Phase and Gated Reviews Relationship . The Phases ( Table 2 ) include the span of activities to execute a Program . They are governed by RLPM Gates that are fixed and have specific exit criteria . Phase activities may overlap . Phases also include Milestone reviews at key points in their execution ( Appendix G – IPMP RLPM Phase and Gated Reviews Relationship , Figure 3 ) . The Milestone reviews have specific criteria or scope and need clear approval for go/no-go decisions . Additional types of reviews are used to manage the Program ; Independent reviews ( e.g . Fellows Review ) and Cadence reviews ( e.g . TCMs , Reliability Meetings ) are identified in , and conducted per , the Program ’ s Management Plans . Phase Pursuit to Start-up Development Production Sustainment Table 2 : IPMP Product life cycle Phases The execution of the Phases is in accordance with the Management Plans . There are 5 such plans as defined in MMP220 : Business , Program , Development , Production and Sustainment . The PMTs own the Management Plans by core function while the Program Plan is owned collaboratively . Each Program is planned and executed in accordance with a specific archetype . The IPMP adjusts to the corresponding level of tailoring for the various activities , reviews , and deliverables . 6.2.1 .

A competitive analysis is conducted . When successful it concludes with the “ Gate A – Strategy ” . [ Ref : MMP220 , MMP444 , EOP47 ] 6.2.1.2 . After the proposed product is identified there is a flow down of the program and design goals to the identified working level teams . Design concepts and requirements are matured and refined . Schedules and deliverables are evolved , clarified and captured in the draft Management Plans . The next step “ Gate B – Submit/Commit ” is permission to make a formal offer the customer . The program business case is baselined and approved in this portion and the other Management Plans are matured towards baseline plans . [ Ref : EOP119 ] 6.2.1.3 . “ Gate C – Startup ” is the gate to pass once the conditions are such that the business is ready for product launch and get permission to launch detail design . By this point the business plan is updated and the remaining Management Plans are baselined . Following this , the Pursuit- to-Startup phase tapers off and concludes as the focus shifts to the Development phase . [ Ref : MMP220 , EOP168 , EOP103 , EOP47 , EOP49 ] Development Phase : Preliminary work for this phase initiates through gates A 6.2.2. and B to support the program offering . The detail design starts after the successful conclusion of “ Gate C – Startup ” . From this point forward the phase is primarily focused on developing and detailing prime design options that meet program and design goals with a formal risk assessment of the product definition and program plans . This phase includes the PDR , CDR , and testing activities which implies important Sub-Gates and milestones such as ordering hardware both for the product development and validation but also ordering production hardware to support the certification activities , as specified in the plans . It also includes manufacturing readiness and preparation for transition to production . The Management Plans are updated throughout .

All aspects of the product characteristics , program risk ( relative to the business case and PDRS ) , production and service readiness are reviewed concluding with “ Gate D – Production Readiness ” which represents the internal authorization to deliver product consistent with the necessary regulatory authorization . Some development activities may extend into this phase . This phase may be concurrent with Product that is in service . Following “ Gate E – Production Closure ” , the activities are reduced to supporting the product in the Sustainment Phase . [ Ref : MMP220 , EOP158 , CSOP-P-41 , QMSP 10-06 ] 6.2.4 . Sustainment Phase : Preliminary work for this phase initiates and ramps up through gates A , B , C and D to ensure the right in-service support is available at “ Entry into Service ” and then throughout the in-service portion . This phase is primarily to support the customer/operator as well as P & WC aftermarket needs . This phase remains ongoing over the life of the program to cater for product in-service performance , maintenance , repairs , spares , and aftermarket support , albeit regulatory , technical , and commercial . Milestone reviews prior to EIS will review all business implementation , product characteristics , economics , production , and service entry characteristics in support of the product launch . This phase will also formally identify , document and incorporate all customer lessons learned , internal lessons learned , and best practice improvements for future products/programs . This lifecycle phase also includes updates to the Management Plans , as necessary , assessments and documentation associated with Continuing Airworthiness and Safety Management responsibilities . Post-cert Engineering and Production activities remain active where projects are needed to meet the business plan needs , develop product improvements , repairs , satisfy continued airworthiness , make spare product , and ensure continued spare parts availability .

"Production activities remain active where projects are needed to meet the business plan needs , develop product improvements , repairs , satisfy continued airworthiness , make spare product , and ensure continued spare parts availability . The two gates in this phase are “ Gate E – Production Closure/Field Support ” which marks the time from which the program focus is reduced to Sustainment and “ Gate F – Discontinuation of Support ” . The responsibilities for continued airworthiness generally extend for as long as the aircraft product remains in service , but this responsibility can have certain limitations or be affected by specific conditions such as Type Certification cessation or transfer of ownership and maintenance responsibility in accordance with regulatory requirements .

Phase accountability is singular through the lifecycle . It transfers from one core member to another as the product matures . The phase accountability transitions from Marketing to Engineering between RLPM Gated Reviews B and C as the design activities intensify and the commercial / contractual discussions are reduced . Similarly , the phase accountability transitions from Operations to Customer Service between RLPM Gated Reviews D and E as the in-service fleet grows and the fleet heath ( or execution of the Sustainment Plan ) drives the PMT activities . These transitions will occur as an agreement between both relevant parties . The overall Program accountability remains as defined in 5.2.1 . While product lifecycle management accountability transfers through the Phases , Engineering remains responsible for the civil aviation regulatory certificate holder obligations ( e.g . maintaining Type Design ) throughout the product ’ s life cycle in accordance with the eDAPM and the DOH .

"& WC ” MANAGEMENT MANUAL Operating Policies and Procedures Classified “ P & WCControlled ” MMP : REVISION : 219 006 Issue Date : APR-01-2025 Page 24 The PMT is a decision-making forum . It is empowered to seek out assistance at any level in the organization in support of the tactical approach required to meet program deliverables withing a given sandbox . Any member of the organization can bring concerns to the PMT for resolution , preferably through that individual ’ s representative on the PMT . The PMT must ensure that formal documentation , indicating courses of action taken throughout the process , is maintained . The PMT must also keep minutes of each meeting and make them accessible in a central repository . A change to the program deliverables – NRE , FSC , DMC , weight , performance , life , timing , etc. , must be approved by the PMMT . One PMT member consulting or reviewing a particular issue with his or her supervisor ( who may be a PMMT member ) does not constitute formal communication between the PMT and the PMMT . The PMT ensures all functional line managers are informed of the team task and membership . Normally , in any particular product development phase , active team membership will not exceed eight representatives . It is the responsibility of each line manager to notify the team if it is felt that a particular discipline has been inadvertently omitted . It may also be necessary to form functional IPTs , such as the Cost IPT , in more complex programs . The participation of our partners and customers at the PMT level shall be encouraged on an as-required basis . F.4 . The IPT , as appointed by the PMT in consultation with the PMMT , consists of representatives on behalf of the designer and developer , the producer , and the customer advocates . This team will clarify and take ownership of the task and identify the requirements for additional membership . The leader of an IPT will depend on the activity , deliverable , and phase of the Program . For example , Project Engineering leads IPTs during the design phase while Customer Engineering is responsible for Reliability IPT . Project Engineering provides ITP leadership at least up to Certification and First Production Article Inspection . During a design activity , an IPT will have complete responsibility for delivering the component , assembly , or system for which it is responsible . The team leader will have responsibility for organizing the team , ensuring appropriate additional membership , including representation from Module Centers , facilitating effective meetings , recording decisions and actions , and providing a focal point for communication with the team and other groups .

The IPT must keep minutes of each meeting and make them accessible in a central repository . The same principles apply to “ non-product ” IPTs such as a “ cost-IPT ” or an “ investigation IPT ” . Team members will share responsibility for attaining the team ’ s goals and objectives . An IPT is responsible for planning , organizing , implementing , and controlling the IPMP activity for the assigned task . The IPT must take early ownership of the IPMP cycle , recognizing they represent their respective functional organizations . It will provide continued communication with their functional management to ensure their actions are understood and agreed to . These members will be responsible for the success of the team as they commit processes , capacities , and other resources to achieve results . F.5 . Decision Making Process The team will be responsible and accountable for the decisions they make . All team members must agree to support group decisions and work unanimously towards achieving the team ’ s goals . If the team can not resolve issues in a timely manner , the issue will be escalated upward through the proper representative . The IPT will escalate upward to the PMT , the PMT to the PMMT , and the PMMT to the President ’ s office via the IPMP Steering Committee . * * Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp.

"Enterprise-level FAQs What is the RTX Lifecycle Program Management ( RLPM ) ? RLPM is a common RTX life-cycle management framework to ensure a standard approach to how the BUs pursue , develop , produce and deliver on programs , products and services to our customers . What phases does RLPM apply to and what is new about it ? RLPM covers the entire life cycle – from bidding through end of life . It has four development phases , six progress gates and 10 fundamental design reviews . Among other standards it includes : • Defined accountability throughout the life cycle . • Shared best practices . • Common language . • Standardized prescriptively with redefined requirements to Collins Aerospace , Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon already have program and product life-cycle frameworks and processes . What is happening to these ? RLPM is built upon a foundation of the existing BU frameworks – CMS ( Collins ) , IPD ( Pratt & Whitney ) and IPDS & Stages ( Raytheon ) – leveraging the best from each . As part of the RLPM phase-in , the BUs are implementing changes to their frameworks to migrate to RLPM , at which point the names of the BU frameworks will be retired and RLPM will become the standard across the company . What is the timing ? What milestones do RTX employees need to be aware of ? The RTX Policy ( GCP-59 ) outlining the framework was approved in October 2024 . Collins , Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon are now working to execute implementation plans to align to the RTX framework , with the goal of completing that work during the second quarter of 2025 . • More rigorous review requirements , including emphasized use How was the framework developed ? accommodate tailoring . of independent reviews . Why are we doing this ? As part of RTX ’ s journey to become the best aerospace and defense company in the world , this framework is centered around driving improvements in execution and ensuring : • Best-in-class performance for our customers ; • Disciplined performance execution ; and • Consistent and clear decision-making and accountability . A working group led by RTX Technology & Global Engineering comprised of representatives from Collins , Pratt & Whitney , Raytheon and related functions developed the framework , leveraging the best from each of the business frameworks , incorporating learnings ( bad and good ) , corrective actions from analysis of problem programs and best practices . The resulting framework is the RLPM system . How do CORE and RLPM work together ? CORE is the RTX Operating System and how we work as a company . CORE aligns all of RTX to our customers ’ top priorities and grounds us in customer requirements . RLPM defines the RTX processes , standards and requirements for how we manage programs and deliver products and services to our customers .",RLPM_FAQs.pdf,RLPM_FAQs.txt,https://home-cdn.rtx.com/-/media/Project/DoZen/DoZenDigitalWorkplace/Initiatives/RTX-Lifecycle-Program-Management/RLPM_FAQs.pdf?rev=6ead36d4125744c38622a47f12d0cd15&sc_lang=en&hash=386820CD6031ACFD56AD63F2AF372E62

"What 's changing at Pratt & Whitney RTX Lifecyle Program Management ( RLPM ) and Pratt & Whitney 's Integrated Program Deployment ( IPD ) and Integrated Product Management Process ( IPMP ) are all scalable approaches to program lifecycle management containing deliberate , gated reviews . RLPM builds on our processes by using the best of each and incorporating lessons learned and best practices from all the other RTX business unit frameworks . IPD and IPMP will be renamed RLPM with a World Procedure ( Level 1 ) containing the elements of the General Corporate Policy 59 ( GCP-59 RLPM ) , including standardized language , phases , gates , reviews and plans . Additional alignment , including clarifications of roles and responsibilities , will be contained in re-written L2 procedures .",What's changing at Pratt & Whitney.docx,What's changing at Pratt & Whitney.txt,https://home.rtx.com/BUs/Pratt-and-Whitney/We-Succeed-Together/RTX-Lifecycle-Program-Management?tab=tabs-8-E2BA831D-79A5-4D9D-8421-5A6C750272DE
